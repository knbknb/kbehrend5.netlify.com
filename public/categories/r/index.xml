      <description>NOTE This blogpost is inspired by this one: Drawing a network with &#34;ggraph&#34; and &#34;tidygraph&#34; by Ken Butler 
 Iâ€™m trying to learn the differences between using the igraph library directly and the new packages ggraph and tidygraph.
Introduction Thomas Lin Pedersen is the author of a lot of packages, including two that deal with graphs (in the sense of networks), tidygraph for storing and handling graphs, and ggraph for drawing them, ggplot-style.</description>
