      <description>NOTE This blogpost is inspired by this one: Drawing a network with &#34;ggraph&#34; and &#34;tidygraph&#34; by Ken Butler. 
 Example: the Figshare categories Data provider Figshare models their contents with and elaborate hierarchy of disciplines.
I’m trying to learn the differences between using the igraph library directly and the new packages ggraph and tidygraph. Both new packages were authored by Thomas Lin Pedersen. created two R packages: tidygraph for storing and handling graphs, and ggraph for drawing them, ggplot-style.</description>
