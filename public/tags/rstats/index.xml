      <description>Blood Pressure as a function of age and body weight Basic analysis of two health datasets from ~ 2010, about the general US Population, and myself. The datasets were gathered independently. One of them is a tiny teaching dataset, the other is a larger medical study. Both datasets show a trend: systolic blood pressure rises about 5-10 mm Hg per decade of a person&amp;apos;s life. The correlation is weak, though; and aging is not the cause for high blood pressure.</description>

      <description>#NHSCrisis? A quick fact check about the National Healthcare Service, NHS. Is the number of nurses in the UK really strongly decreasing, as some media outlets suggest? Or is the opposite true, as some people on Twitter have argued? In this post I am taking a quick look at the number of employees in British healthcare system, from 2009 to 2017.  Since 2014, the number of nurses indeed has decreased for most subtypes.</description>

      <title>Comparing 33C3 and 34C3 tweets</title>

      <description>Why this analysis? There are two reasons:
 learn to process Twitter data at scale (~100MB-1GB/file - that’s large enough for me) get more info from/about the inspiring tweets from the CCC community  (This blogpost ist still a DRAFT - I want to publish quickly, even when an analysis is incomplete, or the text is a bit rough in places)
 Background Occasionally, over the last two years, I have gathered data from the Twitter Streaming API.</description>

      <description>(Under Construction) In 2016, I was harvesting tweets from the Twitter streaming API. I’ve used the #rstats hashtag as the search filter. This hashtag is commonly used by the R community on Twitter. Tag #rstats is more descriptive than the too short, unusable, #R hashtag which may not even be a valid filter expression.
Here I do some exploratory analysis of these ~ 1000 tweets, and I visualize the interactions (the “mentions”) of the active Twitter users as a directed graph.</description>
