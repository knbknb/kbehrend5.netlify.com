      <description>While doing some quality-checks in Kaggle Dataset “European Soccer Database”, I found that in the late 2000s one of the oldest players active in top clubs was Tugay Kerimoğlu, from Turkey. Born in 1970, he played the English Premier League until… when, exactly?</description>

      <description>Still playing with a Soccer Database from Kaggle.com  As an exercise, I wanted to find the oldest players participating in any match. During my analysis I also learned something about the data quality of this Kaggle dataset.
 As mentioned in a previous blogpost, I’ve downloaded a zipfile (36 MB) with Football data from data science community Kaggle.com. The archive contained an SQLite Database.
library(DBI) con &amp;lt;- dbConnect(odbc::odbc(), &amp;quot;well-sqlite-footballdb&amp;quot;) For the sake of brevity, to see the R packages I’ve included to process the data, see the previous blogpost.</description>

      <description>Players in European soccer leagues have a Body Mass Index (BMI) that is normally distributed with a mean of 23 and an sd of 1.3. This is independent of body size.</description>

      <description>Playing with a Soccer Database from Kaggle.com Recently I’ve downloaded as a zipfile (36 MB) from data science community Kaggle.com.
This zipfile contains a single file, a 313 MB sqlite Database. Let’s take a peek what’s inside:
Create connection to football DB
library(DBI) con &amp;lt;- dbConnect(odbc::odbc(), &amp;quot;well-sqlite-footballdb&amp;quot;) Read in R packages necessary to load the data:
# tidyverse packages library(dplyr, warn.conflicts = FALSE) # library(purrr) # functional programming library(stringr) library(lubridate) # strings to datetime library(ggplot2) theme_set(theme_bw()) The database consists of 7 tables.</description>
