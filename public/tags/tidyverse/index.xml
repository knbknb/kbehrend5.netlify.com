      <description>#NHSCrisis? A quick fact check about the National Healthcare Service, NHS. Is the number of nurses in the UK really strongly decreasing, as some media outlets suggest? Or is the opposite true, as some people on Twitter have argued? In this post I am taking a quick look at the number of employees in British healthcare system, from 2009 to 2017.  Since 2014, the number of nurses indeed has decreased for most subtypes.</description>

      <description>NOTE This blogpost is inspired by this one: Drawing a network with &#34;ggraph&#34; and &#34;tidygraph&#34; by Ken Butler. 
 Example: the Figshare categories Data provider Figshare models their contents with and elaborate hierarchy of disciplines.
Iâ€™m trying to learn the differences between using the igraph library directly and the new packages ggraph and tidygraph. Both new packages were authored by Thomas Lin Pedersen. created two R packages: tidygraph for storing and handling graphs, and ggraph for drawing them, ggplot-style.</description>
