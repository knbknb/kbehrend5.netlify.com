      <description>TEST There should be a 3D scene below  A red cube orbiting two other shapes This 3D scene is from a Pluralsight course on WebGL/three.js fundamentals by Alex Mackey. I have included this example here for testing purposes. I want to have a reference, or a simpler alternative, for verifying that exporting 3D plots from the R package \(threejs\) works.
In the future I want to include more complex renderings.</description>

      <description>This is part 1 of a 3-part series of small blog posts about my first attempts at Bayesian Analysis of Soccer data.
In order to get started I had to invest much more effort than expected into cleaning the data and getting familiar with it.
tl;dr: This blog post shows 3 times the same database diagram, at varying levels of detail.
Dataset The dataset used here is the &amp;ldquo;European Soccer Database&amp;rdquo; - 25k+ matches, players &amp;amp; teams attributes for European Professional Football from Kaggle.</description>

      <description>How did Body Mass Index and body size of professional football players change over the years 2008-2016? Body size, not so much. It has stayed rather constant. Average height, body weight and Body Mass Index have fallen.</description>

      <description>While doing some quality-checks in Kaggle Dataset “European Soccer Database”, I found that in the late 2000s most of the oldest professional players active in top clubs were goalkeepers.

      <description>Players in European soccer leagues have a Body Mass Index (BMI) that is normally distributed with a mean of 23 and an sd of 1.3. This is independent of body size.</description>

      <description>Playing with a Soccer Database from Kaggle.com Recently I’ve downloaded as a zipfile (36 MB) from data science community Kaggle.com.
This zipfile contains a single file, a 313 MB sqlite Database. Let’s take a peek what’s inside:
Create connection to football DB
library(DBI) con &amp;lt;- dbConnect(odbc::odbc(), &amp;quot;well-sqlite-footballdb&amp;quot;) Read in R packages necessary to load the data:
# tidyverse packages library(dplyr, warn.conflicts = FALSE) # library(purrr) # functional programming library(stringr) library(lubridate) # strings to datetime library(ggplot2) library(NHANES) # US health data data(NHANES) theme_set(theme_bw()) The database consists of 7 tables.</description>
