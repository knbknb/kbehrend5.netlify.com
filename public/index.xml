      <description>How did Body Mass Index and body size of professional football players change over the years 2008-2016? Body size, not so much. It has stayed rather constant. Average height, body weight and Body Mass Index have fallen.</description>

      <description>Change of body parameters in soccer players  How did body mass index and body size of professional football players change over the years? Body size, not so much. It has stayed rather constant between 2008 and 2016. Average height might have even fallen a little bit. Body weight and, correspondingly, Body Mass Index on the other hand, have fallen even more. This means the top clubs want thinner players. It also means, in soccer, possibilities to increase the athleticism of players is limited.</description>

      <description>While doing some quality-checks in Kaggle Dataset ‚ÄúEuropean Soccer Database‚Äù, I found that in the late 2000s most of the oldest professional players active in top clubs were goalkeepers. Another veteran midfielder was Tugay Kerimoƒülu, from Turkey. Born in 1970, he played the English Premier League until‚Ä¶ when, exactly?</description>

      <description>Still playing with a Soccer Database from Kaggle.com  As an exercise, I wanted to find the oldest players participating in any match. During my analysis I also learned something about the data quality of this Kaggle dataset.
 As mentioned in a previous blogpost, I‚Äôve downloaded a zipfile (36 MB) with Football data from data science community Kaggle.com. The archive contained an SQLite Database.
library(DBI) con &amp;lt;- dbConnect(odbc::odbc(), &amp;quot;well-sqlite-footballdb&amp;quot;) For the sake of brevity, to see the R packages I‚Äôve included to process the data, see the previous blogpost.</description>

      <description>Players in European soccer leagues have a Body Mass Index (BMI) that is normally distributed with a mean of 23 and an sd of 1.3. This is independent of body size.</description>

      <description>Playing with a Soccer Database from Kaggle.com Recently I‚Äôve downloaded as a zipfile (36 MB) from data science community Kaggle.com.
This zipfile contains a single file, a 313 MB sqlite Database. Let‚Äôs take a peek what‚Äôs inside:
Create connection to football DB
library(DBI) con &amp;lt;- dbConnect(odbc::odbc(), &amp;quot;well-sqlite-footballdb&amp;quot;) Read in R packages necessary to load the data:
# tidyverse packages library(dplyr, warn.conflicts = FALSE) # library(purrr) # functional programming library(stringr) library(lubridate) # strings to datetime library(ggplot2) library(NHANES) # US health data data(NHANES) theme_set(theme_bw()) The database consists of 7 tables.</description>
