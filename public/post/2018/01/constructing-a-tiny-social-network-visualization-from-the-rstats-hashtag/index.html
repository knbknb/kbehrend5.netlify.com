<div id="under-construction---checking-if-3-d-plot-below-works" class="section level1">
<h1>(Under Construction - Checking if 3-D plot below works )</h1>
<p>In 2016, I was harvesting tweets from the Twitter streaming API. I’ve used the <code>#rstats</code> hashtag as the search filter. This hashtag is commonly used in the R community on Twitter. Tag <code>#rstats</code> is more descriptive than the too short, unusable, <code>#R</code> hashtag which may not even be a valid filter expression.</p>
<p>Load the necessary R packages, and the datafiles.</p>
<pre class="r"><code>options(knitr.table.format = &quot;html&quot;) 
library(here)
library(stringr)
library(lubridate)
library(threejs)
library(tidyverse)
library(igraph)

datadir &lt;- &quot;data/twitter&quot;
# (extracts from the full tweets data, explained below)
infile0 &lt;- here::here(datadir, &quot;rstats_tweettimes.txt&quot;)
infile1 &lt;- here::here(datadir, &quot;rstats_network.txt&quot;)</code></pre>
<p>Convert dates to strings, group them into day-of-month, and hours-of-day:</p>
<pre><code>## Parsed with column specification:
## cols(
##   dt = col_character(),
##   id = col_double()
## )</code></pre>
<p>From 2016-07-08 22:17:33 to 2016-07-10 08:14:23 I gathered 977 tweets, encoded in JSON format.<br />
Each tweet contains about 2500 characters. This might surprise you, because a tweet used to be 140 characters in length, until Twitter increased it to 280 characters in 2017. But a tweet contains a lot of metadata, and this enlarges the length of a tweet to exceed 2000 characters, when serialized to a one-line JSON string.</p>
<p>In a different blogpost (‘<a href="/post/2017/12/learning-jq">Learning jq</a>’) I’ve explained how to extract specific fields from the nested structure. See example 4.</p>
<p>This plot shows the user activity during this period:</p>
<pre class="r"><code>theme_set(theme_bw())
tweetdates %&gt;% ggplot(aes(hour)) +
  geom_bar(fill=&quot;dodgerblue&quot;) +
        facet_wrap(~ day, nrow = 1) +
        xlab(&quot;Hour of Day&quot;)+ ylab(&quot;Tweets per Hour&quot;) +
        ggtitle(&quot;#Rstats Tweets in July 2016&quot;)</code></pre>
<p><img src="/post/2018-01-01-constructing-a-tiny-social-network-visualization-from-the-rstats-hashtag_files/figure-html/plot1-1.png" width="864" /></p>
<p>The text file with the user data and the important “mentions” metadata can be read in as a data frame:</p>
<pre class="r"><code>mentions &lt;- read_csv(infile1)
# remove leading &quot;_&quot; from column names
colnames(mentions) &lt;- gsub(&quot;^_&quot;, &quot;&quot;, colnames(mentions), perl = TRUE)</code></pre>
<p>Convert it to an igraph object <code>gr</code>, a network:</p>
<pre class="r"><code>users &lt;- mentions %&gt;% 
        select(name) %&gt;% 
        dplyr::union(mentions %&gt;% 
                             select(mentions_name) %&gt;% 
                             rename(name =&quot;mentions_name&quot;))


gr &lt;- mentions %&gt;% 
        select(name, mentions_name) %&gt;%
        unique() %&gt;% 
        filter(name != mentions_name) %&gt;% 
        graph_from_data_frame(directed = TRUE, vertices = users)

gr &lt;- set_vertex_attr(gr, &quot;color&quot;, value = &quot;dodgerblue&quot;)

# Redraw the graph and make the vertex size 1

ec &lt;- as.numeric(eigen_centrality(gr)$vector)

# Create new vector &#39;v&#39; that is equal to the square-root of &#39;ec&#39; 
# multiplied by some scaling factor, here: 2
v &lt;- 2 * sqrt(ec)

# Plot threejs plot of graph setting vertex size to v
graphjs(gr, vertex.size = v, vertex.label = TRUE, 
        main=&quot;#Rstats tweet network, ~1 day in July 2016&quot;)</code></pre>
