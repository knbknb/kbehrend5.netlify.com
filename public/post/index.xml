      <description>Still playing with a Soccer Database from Kaggle.com  As an exercise, I wanted to find the oldest player participating in any match. My analysis also revealed a lot about the data quality of this Kaggle dataset.
 As mentioned in a previous blogpost, I’ve downloaded a zipfile (36 MB) with Football data from data science community Kaggle.com. The archive contained an SQLite Database.
library(DBI) con &amp;lt;- dbConnect(odbc::odbc(), &amp;quot;well-sqlite-footballdb&amp;quot;) For the sake of brevity, to see the R packages I’ve included to process the data, see the previous blogpost.</description>

This zipfile contains a single file, a 313 MB sqlite Database. Let’s take a peek what’s inside:
Create connection to football DB
library(DBI) con &amp;lt;- dbConnect(odbc::odbc(), &amp;quot;well-sqlite-footballdb&amp;quot;) Read in R packages necessary to load the data:
# tidyverse packages library(dplyr, warn.conflicts = FALSE) # library(purrr) # functional programming library(stringr) library(lubridate) # strings to datetime library(ggplot2) theme_set(theme_bw()) The database consists of 7 tables.</description>
