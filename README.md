Knut Behrends' personal blog (v3)

See https://kbehrends.netlify.com

🐣 Site went online November 2017;

after trying various 

- hosting providers, 
- content management systems, 
- database-backed web sites
- static-site generators, 

after playing with their settings, extensions, plugins and themes,

I currently use [Hugo](https://gohugo.io).

Most of my blog-posts contain simple data-analyses created with [R](https://www.r-project.org).
