Fame requires every kind of excess.
True fame
Devouring neon
Somber renown
Long journeys across gray space.
I mean danger
The edge of every void
The circumstance of one man
Dreams of the republic.
Understand the man
Inhabiting extreme regions
Damp with memories
Absorbed into the public’s total madness;
Fully rational
A bureaucrat in hell
A secret genius of survival
Destroyed by the public’s contempt for survivors
Fame,this special kind, feeds itself on outrage
Bizarre litigation
Treachery, pandemonium and drugs.
Wanted: more than music
Reduplicated noise.
Culture had reached its limit
A point of severe tension.
Simple visceral abandon
Not concerned with precedent now.
Fearfully so
Unlabeled flesh.
Storm the barricades
Scratching at the stage
Self-willed
A successful piece of instruction
By my own hand
Merely pantomimed
Making absolutely no sound.
Stand in the incandescent pit
All totally silent.
Deprived of people’s screams
Next to meaningless
A profound joke
A lesson in something or other.
Saying nothing
And boarded a plane for new york city
That contaminated shrine
As to the rest
For various members of the managerial peerage.
Closer to understanding my disappearance than anyone else.
It was not quite as total as the act they needed
Nobody could be sure whether i was gone for good.
For my closest followers
All it foreshadowed was a period of waiting.
Either i’d return with a new language for them to speak or...
Seek a divine silence attendant to my own.
I took a taxi past the cemeteries
Tides of ash-light breaking across the spires.
Older than the cities of europe
A sadistic gift of the sixteenth century
Ever on the verge of plague.
Take the tunnel.
Is there a tunnel?
Vast but nothing on that first night
Against the structure itself
Smashing whatever was smashable
Trying to rip up the artificial turf
Attacking the very plumbing.
The gates were opened
Blank-looking
Hiding the feast
Behind metered eyes.
Cracking arms and legs
Protecting the concept of regulated temperature.
One of the worst public statements of the year
The tunnel goes under the river.
Counting the cars going by.
One two three four.
One two three.
I was interested in endings
How to survive a dead idea.
What came next
For the wounded
I was able to learn
Beyond certain personal limits
In endland
Far from the tropics of fame.
