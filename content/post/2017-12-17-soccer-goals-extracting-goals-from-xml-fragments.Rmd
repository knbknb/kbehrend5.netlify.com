This is part 2 of a 3-part series about Statistical Analysis of Soccer data. 

- [Part 1](/post/2017/12/soccerdb-schema-diagrams/) shows the database diagram of the Sqlite database mentioned below.
- Part 2 (this page) describes how to preprocess some text data that was stored in an cryptic format inside the database
- [Part 3](/post/2018/01/soccer-scoring-best/) describes some statistical analysis of some aspect of this dataset.

#### Dataset 


The dataset used here is the ["European Soccer Database" - 25k+ matches, players & teams attributes for European Professional Football](https://www.kaggle.com/hugomathien/soccer/) from Kaggle.com. This dataset is delivered as an Sqlite database. It contains 7 tables which have been populated by the original curator in 2014-2016.
The data comes from many internet sources.

```{r DBI, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE, echo=FALSE}

library(DBI)
con <- dbConnect(odbc::odbc(), "well-sqlite-footballdb")

```
For the sake of brevity, I cannot repeat this information here. To see database internals, see the [previous blogpost](/post/2017/12/soccerdb-schema-diagrams/). 

```{r }
library(lubridate) # strings to datetime
library(tidyverse, warn.conflicts = FALSE)

theme_set(theme_bw())
```


The database consists of 7 tables. We'll read in all of them. The `Player` table contains basic data of ~10000 soccer players from the top leagues of 14 European countries. They are not strictly "European soccer players", but players from all over the globe, competing in the top leagues of certain Western European countries.

```{r, echo=FALSE, results='hide'}
table_names <- dbListTables(con)

good <- !  str_detect(table_names, "sqlite_sequence")
table_names <- table_names[good]

# Import all tables as data frames, 308MB
# feasible with lots of RAM
walk(table_names,function(x) assign(x,
dbReadTable(x, conn=con),
envir = globalenv()))
dbDisconnect(con)
```


#### The problem 

The problem I am solving here: Important information is stored inside the database, but the data is given in an unusable format. In this post I show how to transform the data content from these columns into a usable format.

The "goal" column, which is column 34 in the "Match" table has a TEXT datatype: `r htmltools::HTML('{{< figure src="/img/post/footballb--diagram--matchtable-goalscolumn.png" title="" >}}')`

This in itself is not a problem. However, an entry in this table typically looks like this:

```{r xml1, message=TRUE, results='asis'}
library(xml2)
xmlparse <- function(s){
        read_xml(s) %>% 
                xml_find_all(".//player1")  %>% 
                xml_text()  %>% 
                str_c( collapse="\t")
}


# get 1 XML fragment for game 489042
xmlfrag <- Match %>% 
        select(match_api_id, goal)  %>% 
        filter(!is.na(goal)) %>% 
        filter(match_api_id == 489042) %>%
        select(goal) %>% 
        unique() %>% 
        rename("Goals for Game 489042:" = "goal") 

xmlout <- system(command = "tidy -q -i -xml ",
        input = as.character(xmlfrag), 
       intern = TRUE)

```

```xml
`r paste(xmlout, collapse = '\n')`
```

This is XML text. The XML fragment was scraped from some website, and the curator of the database did not fully finish the job of parsing the information out of this. There is very detailed information (team ids; goaltype,...) inside, which is tedious to extract. And if the data was fully extracted, the new data would make the database design even more complicated, because more tables would be needed.

#### What does the XML text fragments contain?

With regard to the XML fragment, I think the `<player1>` element means this guy scored, `<player2>` made the assist. 

These are the two `<player1>` we are interested in, with the following `player_api_id`s:

```{r cho=TRUE}
(scorer_api_ids <- xmlfrag  %>% 
        as.character() %>%
        xmlparse() %>%
        str_split(pattern =  "\t") %>% 
        unlist() %>% 
        as.numeric())
```

I've looked it up for game 489042, [Manchester United vs Newcastle, first PL game in Season 2008/2009, on August 17, 2008](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2008%E2%80%9309_Manchester_United_F.C._season), the player IDs are correct.

```{r}
Player %>% 
        filter(player_api_id %in% scorer_api_ids) %>% 
        select(player_api_id, player_name, birthday) %>% 
        mutate(birthday = format.Date(birthday, "%Y-%m-%d"))
```

These guys actually scored in that game.


#### Extracting goals from XML text

There are `r nrow(Match)` Matches in the database, and we have goal information for about 50% of them.

The goals can be extracted with this code:

```{r xml2, echo=TRUE, eval=TRUE, warning=FALSE}
xmlparse2 <- function(s){
                read_xml(s) %>%
                xml_find_all(".//player1") %>%
                xml_text(trim = TRUE) %>%
                str_c(collapse = "\t") %>% 
                str_c("")
}

# Parse xml and store result in tab-sep string
Match_Player_Goal <- Match %>%
        select(match_api_id, goal) %>%
        filter(!is.na(goal)) %>%
        filter(goal != "<goal />") %>%
        transmute(match_api_id = match_api_id,
                  goals_by = map_chr(goal, xmlparse2))
```

```{r xml3, echo=TRUE, eval=TRUE, warning=FALSE}

# assume there are no more than 20 goals per match
into <- map2_chr("Goal", 1:20, str_c)

# convert them into key-value table
Match_Player_Goal.2 <- Match_Player_Goal %>%
        separate(goals_by, into = into, "\t") %>%
        gather(k, player_api_id, -match_api_id) %>%
        filter(!is.na(player_api_id)) %>%
        mutate(player_api_id =  as.integer(player_api_id)) %>%
        arrange(match_api_id, k)

```

Add Player Names and Match names to this data frame:

```{r}

Match_Player_Goal.3 <- Player %>% 
        select(player_api_id, player_name) %>% 
        right_join(Match_Player_Goal.2, by = "player_api_id") %>% 
        arrange(match_api_id, player_api_id) 
        
        

```


```{r read, eval=FALSE}
mplg_rds <- "data/Match_Player_Goal.3.RDS"
if(!file.exists(mplg_rds)){
 Match_Player_Goal.3 <- readRDS(mplg_rds)        
}

```


A few sample datasets from the new `Match_Player_Goal.3` dataframe, 
which has `r nrow(Match_Player_Goal.3)` rows:

```{r eval=TRUE}

head(Match_Player_Goal.3, 5)
```

Which player has scored the most goals?

```{r season, eval=TRUE}
#saveRDS(Match_Player_Goal.3, file="data_private/Match_Player_Goal.3.RDS")

Match_Season <- Match %>%
        select(match_api_id, season)

Player_most_goals <- Match_Player_Goal.3 %>%
        left_join(Match_Season) %>% 
        group_by(player_api_id, player_name, season) %>%
        summarise(goals = n()) %>%
        arrange(desc(goals)) %>% 
        ungroup()

Player_most_goals_season <- Player_most_goals %>% 
        inner_join(Player )

```

The following table is not particularly insightful; it just shows that I've more or less correctly parsed the XML-fragments in the datatable. We have `r nrow(Player_most_goals_season)` players which shot `r sum(Player_most_goals_season$goals)` goals in total, in `r length(unique(Player_most_goals_season$season))` seasons. 

```{r mostg, echo=FALSE}
Player_most_goals_season %>% 
        select(-height, -weight, -player_fifa_api_id) %>%
        mutate(birthday = year(birthday)) %>% 
        select(season, player_name, goals, birthday, player_api_id) %>% 
        head(30) %>% 
        knitr::kable(caption="Goals per player and season", row.names=1, align="clccc") %>% 
        kableExtra::kable_styling(bootstrap_options = c("striped", "hover"))

```

Someone has counted Messi's goals independently and [found 52 goals](https://www.barcablaugranes.com/2012/8/15/3242689/fc-barcelona-2011-12-season-in-review-lionel-messi), confirming the  data listed in this table.

Goals per match

```{r}
n_matches = n_distinct(Match_Player_Goal.3$match_api_id)
Match_Player_Goal.3 %>% 
        select(match_api_id, player_api_id) %>% 
        group_by(match_api_id) %>% 
        summarize(cnt_goals =n()) %>%
        ggplot(aes(cnt_goals) ) +
        geom_histogram(binwidth=0.5,  fill="navy") +
        ggtitle("Goals per Match", subtitle=sprintf("%s Matches with at least 1 goal", n_matches)) +
        xlab("Goals Count [per Match]") + ylab("Number of Matches")+
        theme(legend.position = "none") +
        scale_x_continuous(labels = 1:14, breaks=1:14)


```

We can see that the curve peaks at 2 goals per match, but the curve is skewed to the right (fatter on the right half of the peak).

### What is the average number of goals any player will score?

This is much more difficult to determine, because we don't know how many times the player was in the squad but did not play, or when I was sick and could not play. 
Thus We only can calculate an average for players who have actually scored: 

```{r echo=FALSE}
n_players <- n_distinct(Match_Player_Goal.3$player_api_id)
Match_Player_Goal.3 %>% 
        select(player_api_id, match_api_id, k) %>% 
        mutate(match_api_id = ifelse(is.na(match_api_id) , 0, 
                                        match_api_id),
               k = ifelse(is.na(k) , 0, 
                                        1)) %>% 
        group_by(player_api_id, match_api_id) %>%
        summarize(cnt_goals = n()) %>%
        summarize(cnt_goals = mean(cnt_goals)) %>% 
        ggplot(aes(cnt_goals) ) +
        geom_histogram(fill="navy", binwidth=0.05) +
        ggtitle("Goals per Match and Player", subtitle=sprintf("%s Matches by %s  Players who scored at least once", n_matches, n_players)) +
        xlab("Goals per Match and Player") + ylab("Number of Matches")+
        theme(legend.position = "none") +
        scale_x_continuous(labels = seq(0.5,2.5, 0.1), 
                           breaks=seq(.5,2.5, 0.1), 
                           limits = c(0.5,2.5)) +
        scale_y_log10()
        
```

Note logarithmic scale on the y axis.

We see that even among those players who actually scored, the scoring average per match declines exponentially very quickly. Scoring 1.3 goals per match is very good, and 1.5 goals is extraordinary, very few players actually achieve this. (The peak at 2 goals per match and player is probably due to a few players who have played only in a single game but have shot two goals in that game.)

These numbers can be used as Priors for any subsequent Bayesian analysis. (TBC)
