summary: While doing some quality-checks in Kaggle Dataset "[European Soccer Database](https://www.kaggle.com/hugomathien/soccer)", I found that in the late 2000s one of the oldest players who was not a goalkeeper and active in top clubs was Tugay Kerimoğlu, from Turkey. Born in 1970, he played the English Premier League until... when, exactly?

<h3>Still playing with a Soccer Database from Kaggle.com</h3>
<blockquote>
<p>As an exercise, I wanted to find the oldest players participating in any match. During my analysis I also learned something about the data quality of this Kaggle dataset.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>As mentioned in a <a href="/post/2017/11/european-soccer-players-and-their-bmi/">previous blogpost</a>, I’ve downloaded a <a href="https://www.kaggle.com/hugomathien/soccer/downloads/soccer.zip">zipfile (36 MB)</a> with Football data from data science community <a href="https://www.kaggle.com/hugomathien/soccer">Kaggle.com</a>. The archive contained an SQLite Database.</p>
<pre class="r"><code>library(DBI)
con &lt;- dbConnect(odbc::odbc(), &quot;well-sqlite-footballdb&quot;)</code></pre>
<p>For the sake of brevity, to see the R packages I’ve included to process the data, see the <a href="/post/2017/11/european-soccer-players-and-their-bmi/">previous blogpost</a>. Only the <code>tidyr</code> package is new here.</p>
<pre class="r"><code>library(tidyr)   # gather</code></pre>
<p>The database consists of 7 tables. We’ll read in all of them. The Player table contains basic data of ~10000 soccer players from the top leagues of 14 European countries. They are not strictly “European soccer players”, but players from all over the globe, competing in the top leagues of certain Western European countries.</p>
<p>Tables in the Sqlite database:</p>
<pre><code>##                     Rows Columns
## Player_Attributes 183978      42
## Player             11060       7
## Match              25979     115
## League                11       3
## Country               11       2
## Team                 299       5
## Team_Attributes     1458      25</code></pre>
<p>The <code>Player</code> table lists the soccer players’ data.</p>
<p>The <code>Match</code> table contains data from 25979 matches, played between 2008-07-18 and 2016-05-25. The table contains 115 columns.</p>
<p>The names of the players comprising the teams are listed in 22 columns named <code>home_player_1</code> to <code>home_player_11</code>, and <code>away_player_1</code> to <code>away_player_11</code>. The substitute players nominated for the match are not known.</p>
<p>This database table has an untidy format. Let’s tidy it with the <code>tidyr::gather()</code> function:</p>
<pre class="r"><code>Match_players  &lt;- Match %&gt;%
        select(match_api_id, season, league_id, 
               home_player_1:away_player_11) %&gt;%
        rename(&quot;match_id&quot; = match_api_id)  %&gt;%
        gather( k, player_api_id,  -match_id, -season, -league_id)</code></pre>
<p>This table now looks like this:</p>
<pre class="r"><code>head(Match_players %&gt;% filter(!is.na(player_api_id)), 5)</code></pre>
<pre><code>##   match_id    season league_id             k player_api_id
## 1   493016 2008/2009         1 home_player_1         39890
## 2   493017 2008/2009         1 home_player_1         38327
## 3   493018 2008/2009         1 home_player_1         95597
## 4   493020 2008/2009         1 home_player_1         30934
## 5   493021 2008/2009         1 home_player_1         37990</code></pre>
<p>I’ve only shown 5 rows of this 571538 x 5 table. This table can now be joined with the <code>Player</code> table:</p>
<pre class="r"><code>Player_in_match &lt;- Player %&gt;%
        inner_join(Match_players, by = c(&quot;player_api_id&quot; = &quot;player_api_id&quot;)) %&gt;%
        mutate(year_of_birth = year(birthday)) %&gt;%
        rename(&quot;player_id&quot; = id)</code></pre>
<p>This table, <code>Player_in_match</code> is a 542281 x 12 table. Remember, the original, standalone <code>Match_players</code> table had 571538 records. The join reduced this to 542281 athletes. Hence, many players didn’t actually play, or the screenscraping process did not yield any information about the matches they ’ve participated in; or the parse-process of many downloaded files containing the matches data failed. In any case, they actually played or were nominated for the starting formation of their squads.</p>
<pre class="r"><code>Player_distinct_by_year &lt;- Player_in_match %&gt;%
        select(year_of_birth, season, player_api_id) %&gt;%
        group_by(year_of_birth, season) %&gt;%
        summarize(distinct_players =n_distinct(player_api_id))

Player_distinct_by_year %&gt;%
        ggplot(aes(year_of_birth, distinct_players, color=season)) +
        geom_point( size=.4) +
        geom_smooth(method=&quot;loess&quot;, se=FALSE, size=0.5) +
        ylab(&quot;Number of distinct Players in Database&quot;) +
        xlab(&quot;Player&#39;s Year of Birth&quot;) +
        ggtitle(&quot;Number of distinct Players in the &#39;European Soccer Database&quot;,
                subtitle = &quot;Counting Players&#39; appearances in the squads. Seasons 2008-2016.\n
Each player is counted once per season no matter how often he played.&quot;)</code></pre>
<p><img src="/post/2017-12-03-european-soccer-players--oldest_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-9-1.png" width="768" /></p>
<p>Some players were rarely nominated for the squad of any match. This can best be seen at the left side of the graph. These data points represent older players born before 1970.</p>
<p>Why do the humps have different heights? I think for older seasons, there is simply less data available at the websites of the commercial data vendors, where the data was scraped from.</p>

<p>Before I studied this dataset, the oldest player, Alberto Fontana, was completely unknown to me. So let’s lookup some metadata about this player, and the other players born before 1971, in the Google Knowledge Graph.</p>
<p>The calculation in the following code block is a bit awkward and verbose, because</p>
<ul>
<li>Google Knowledge Graph does <em>not</em> return records with a perfectly consistent structure. I have to transform it to a consistent 2-column (key-value) table.</li>
<li>the Google Knowledge Graph data contains -in this context- irrelevant info such as license data about photographs etc that I had too filter out.</li>
<li>the database does not keep track of accents and special characters of the Turkish alphabet, so I better use the correctly encoded string from Wikipedia/Google.</li>
</ul>

<h2>More quality checks: Tugay’s last matches</h2>
<p>One of the older players is Tugay Kerimoğlu, born 1970. I didn’t know anything about him before. Wikipedia says Tugay played for the Blackburn Rovers during his last years.</p>
<p>Does the database also say that? Luckily, yes:</p>
<p>Let’s find out which teams Tugay played for during his last seasons. For each record in the Match table, there exists an entry with <code>home_team_api_id</code> and <code>away_team_api_id</code>. In order to resolve anonymous team-ids to the actual team names, I join the team-ids <em>twice</em> to the oldest_players_in_any_match table. This yields two augmented temporary tables.</p>
<pre class="r"><code># get a smaller version of the Team table
Team_sm &lt;- Team %&gt;%  select(id, team_api_id, team_long_name)

oldest_augm &lt;- oldest_players_in_any_match %&gt;%
        select(-season) %&gt;%
        inner_join(Match, by = c(&quot;match_id&quot; = &quot;match_api_id&quot;)) %&gt;%
        inner_join(Team_sm, by = c(&quot;home_team_api_id&quot; = &quot;team_api_id&quot;)) %&gt;%
        rename(&quot;home_team&quot; = &quot;team_long_name&quot;) %&gt;% 
        filter(player_name == &quot;Tugay Kerimoglou&quot;)


oldest_augm2 &lt;- oldest_augm %&gt;%
        inner_join(Team_sm, by = c(&quot;away_team_api_id&quot; = &quot;team_api_id&quot;)) %&gt;%
        rename(&quot;away_team&quot; = &quot;team_long_name&quot;)

oldest_augm2 %&gt;%
        select(season, match_id, home_team, away_team) %&gt;%
        arrange(season, match_id) %&gt;% 
        ht()           # head() and tail()</code></pre>

<p>So the database says that Tugay Kerimoğlu has played for Blackburn rovers, and did so until the 2008/2009 season. According to the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tugay_Kerimo%C4%9Flu">Wikipedia article about him</a>, this is true.</p>
<div id="my-take-home-message" class="section level3">
<h3>My take home-message</h3>
<p>Needless to say, the creators of the database did a great job in compiling this dataset. The database design is pretty clean, and the fact that there are even some Primary-Foreign Key Constraints between the table inside the database make it stand out. The mappings of player-ids to match-ids seem to be correct in most places.</p>

<h3>Minor quality problem: players with digits in their names</h3>
<p>Further examination revealed that another small problem with the Players table. I mention this here because it is not worth an independent blog-post.</p>
<p>This R code reveals that some player names have been parsed incorrectly.</p>
<pre class="r"><code>players_weird_names &lt;- Player %&gt;% 
        select(player_name) %&gt;% 
        filter(str_detect(player_name, &quot;\\d&quot;) == TRUE)</code></pre>

</table>
<p>There are 80 Players with digits in their names. I’ve only shown a few of them in the table above. This formatting issue looks so systematic that I suspect that it is the result of an incorrect parse, and maybe a misplaced age calculation.</p>
