#### Lasso Regression on Blood Pressure Data (NHANES Dataset)


```{r abstr, echo=FALSE}
htmltools::HTML('<div class="alert alert-info"><b>Performing Lasso Regression on anonymized data from 10000 people representing the general US Population</b>. Actually I will also try out other model selection techniques.
</div>')
```
This is a continuation from [another blog post](/post/2018/02/bloodpressure-nhanes) of mine. When I was nearly done with writing that post, some new open questions came to my mind.

There was  not really a hypothesis. I just realized that I need to try out all those fancy Machine Learning algorithms that I encountered during MOOC homework assignments. This time I'll try these techniques out on  datasets that *I* find interesting.

In the preceding blogpost I noticed that there exists a link between Systolic Blood Pressure as a function of age and weight, but the trend was noisy and the correlation was weak. 

Can I determine some other variables (out of the 77) that are also "governing" the Blood Pressure in some way?

I am not trying to postulate any causation here. Hey I'm just a blogger and playing with a dataset.

#### NHANES dataset

 NHANES is  the US National Health and Nutrition Examination Study. It is a carefully curated, larger medical survey aiming to get a representative sample of the general US population. The survey is carried out periodically.

The *NHANES* dataset is available as an R package on [CRAN](https://cran.r-project.org/package=NHANES). I have used package version 2.1.0, specifically "NHANES 2009-2012 with adjusted weighting". This dataset contains some corrections for undersampling racial minorities. Uncorrected data is also available, in the *NHANESraw* package.

#### Preprocessing 

Load the necessary packages. 

```{r pkgs, echo=TRUE, cache=FALSE}
library(tidyverse)
library(NHANES) # Body Shape + related measurements from 10000 US citizens
data(NHANES)
```

```{r theme}
library(ggthemes)
theme_set(theme_economist_white())
scale_colour_discrete <- function(...) scale_color_brewer(palette="Set1")
```

We will try to model  Blood Pressure as a function of a whole lot of other variables. 
It only makes sense to deal with Nonzero Values here. So, for starters, we drop all rows where column `BPSysAve` is empty / NA. 


```{r filterNHANES, echo=TRUE}
NHANES <- NHANES %>% filter(! is.na(BPSysAve) )
```

Now there are still  `nrow(na.omit(NHANES))` rows of `r nrow(NHANES)` which have nonempty values in *all* columns assigned. For our analysis, we need to drop some columns or impute missing ones.

These are  the column names and some other important metadata of the NHANES dataset. 
```{r}
Hmisc::contents(NHANES)
```
