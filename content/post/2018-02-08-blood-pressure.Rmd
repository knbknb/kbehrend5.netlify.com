#### Blood Pressure as a function of age and body weight


```{r abstr, echo=FALSE}
htmltools::HTML('<div class="alert alert-info"><b>Very basic analysis of two health datasets about the  General US Population in 2010.</b>
                The data were gathered independently. One of them is a tiny teaching dataset, the other is a large study. Both datasets show that blood pressure rises about 5 mm Hg per decade. </div>')
```

Conversations with friends and colleagues  kept me  thinking about blood pressure lately.
Then I've remembered that weekend project from late 2017. Back then I had analysed two datasets:   one available on the internet, the other available as R package NHANES on CRAN. 
My motivation in writing this up was half learning *ggplot*, half gaining insights from data by moving from a small teaching dataset to a messy, much larger dataset from a real medical study.

Load the necessary packages. Nothing fancy here.

```{r pkgs}
library(readxl)
library(tidyverse)
theme_set(theme_bw())
```

Download **dataset 1**: A tiny 11x4 table called `Systolic Blood Pressure`. It comes from [a book publisher's website.](http://college.cengage.com/mathematics/brase/understandable_statistics/7e/students/datasets/mlr/frames/frame.html). Maybe it is a teaching dataset, perhaps supplementary material for a college textbook.

The [markdown version  of this blog post](https://github.com/knbknb/kbehrends.netlify.com/tree/master/content) contains the necessary instructions on how to download and import the data.

```{r IOstuff, echo=FALSE}
xlsurl <- "http://college.cengage.com/mathematics/brase/understandable_statistics/7e/students/datasets/mlr/excel/mlr02.xls"
xls <- basename(xlsurl)
folder <- "data_private"
destfile <- here::here(file.path(folder, xls))
destfile2 <- here::here(file.path(folder, "mlr02.csv"))

if (!file.exists(destfile)) {
  download.file(xlsurl, destfile = destfile, method = "curl")
  xlstmp <- read_xls(destfile)
  # col1 = systolic blood pressure
  # col2 = age in years
  # col3 = weight in pounds
  # TODO: document how converted to csv
}
# read in a properly formatted csv file
bloodpressure <- read_csv(destfile2, col_names = TRUE)
# Convert bodyweights from pounts to kilograms:
bloodpressure <- bloodpressure %>%
  mutate(weight = weight_pounds * 0.453592)

```

The dataset is tiny:

```{r ds1, echo=FALSE}
glimpse(bloodpressure)
```

```{r echo=FALSE, eval=FALSE}
# The summary takes up more room than the data itself.
summary(bloodpressure)
```

We can plot it in its entirety. I also fit a simple linear regression mode to the data. Blood Pressure as a function of a person's age and body weight.
```{r tiny1, echo=FALSE}
bloodpressure_model <- lm(blood_pressure ~ age + weight, data = bloodpressure)

# Print bloodpressure_model and call summary()
bloodpressure_model
summary(bloodpressure_model)

# predict blood pressure using bloodpressure_model :prediction
bloodpressure$prediction <- predict(bloodpressure_model, data = bloodpressure)

ggplot(bloodpressure, aes(prediction, blood_pressure)) +
  geom_point() +
  geom_abline(color = "blue")

```

Adding the predictions from the model:

```{r tiny2, echo=FALSE, fig.cap="Predicted values are shown in red."}

ggplot(bloodpressure, aes(age, blood_pressure)) +
  geom_point() +
  geom_smooth(method="lm") +
  geom_point(aes(age, prediction), color = "red", size = 1)

```
