#### Blood Pressure as a function of age and body weight


```{r abstr, echo=FALSE}
htmltools::HTML('<div class="alert alert-info"><b>Very basic analysis of two health datasets from ~ 2010, about the general US Population.</b>
The data were gathered independently. One of them is a tiny teaching dataset, the other is a larger study. Both datasets show that systolic blood pressure rises about 5-10 mm Hg per decade of a person &apos;s life. </div>')
```

Recently, conversations with friends and colleagues  kept me  thinking about blood pressure.
Then I've remembered that weekend project from late 2017. Back then I had analysed two datasets:   one available on the internet, the other available as R package [NHANES on CRAN](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/NHANES/index.html). 

My motivation in writing this up was (1) learning more *ggplot* tricks, and more imortantly, (2) gaining insights from a real data that interests me. It was also a helpful exercise to start with a small teaching dataset, then switch to a messier, larger dataset: a real medical study with data from 10000 people.

#### Preprocessing 

Load the necessary packages. Nothing fancy here.

```{r pkgs, echo=TRUE, cache=FALSE}
library(readxl)
library(tidyverse)
library(ggthemes)
theme_set(theme_economist_white())
scale_colour_discrete <- function(...) scale_color_brewer(palette="Set1")

```

Download **dataset 1**: A tiny 11*4 table called `Systolic Blood Pressure`. It comes from [a book publisher's website](http://college.cengage.com/mathematics/brase/understandable_statistics/7e/students/datasets/mlr/frames/frame.html). Maybe it is a teaching dataset; perhaps is is supplementary material for a college textbook.

The [markdown version  of this blog post](https://github.com/knbknb/kbehrends.netlify.com/tree/master/content) contains the necessary instructions on how to download and import the data.

```{r IOstuff, echo=FALSE}
xlsurl <- "http://college.cengage.com/mathematics/brase/understandable_statistics/7e/students/datasets/mlr/excel/mlr02.xls"
xls <- basename(xlsurl)
folder <- "data_private"
destfile <- here::here(file.path(folder, xls))
destfile2 <- here::here(file.path(folder, "mlr02.csv"))

if (!file.exists(destfile)) {
  download.file(xlsurl, destfile = destfile, method = "curl")
  xlstmp <- read_xls(destfile)
  # col1 = systolic blood pressure
  # col2 = age in years
  # col3 = weight in pounds
  # TODO: document how converted to csv
}
# read in a properly formatted csv file
bloodpressure <- read_csv(destfile2, col_names = TRUE)
# Convert bodyweights from pounts to kilograms:
bloodpressure <- bloodpressure %>%
  mutate(weight = weight_pounds * 0.453592)

```

#### Dataset 1

The dataset is tiny:

```{r ds1, echo=FALSE}
glimpse(bloodpressure)
```

```{r echo=FALSE, eval=FALSE}
# The summary takes up more room than the data itself.
summary(bloodpressure)
```

We can plot it in its entirety. I also fit a simple linear regression model to the data: Blood Pressure as a function of a person's age and body weight.

```{r tiny1,  results='hide'}
bloodpressure_model <- lm(blood_pressure ~ age + weight, data = bloodpressure)


# predict blood pressure using bloodpressure_model :prediction
bloodpressure$prediction <- predict(bloodpressure_model, data = bloodpressure)


```

Adding the predictions from the model to the plot:

```{r tiny2, echo=FALSE, fig.cap=" Predicted values are shown in red, observed values in black."}

ggplot(bloodpressure, aes(age, blood_pressure)) +
  geom_point() +
  geom_smooth(method="lm") +
  geom_point(aes(age, prediction), color = "red", size = 1) +
        ggtitle("Blood pressure as a function of age and body weight.", subtitle="Systolic Blood pressure [mm Hg]. Note age-range on x-axis.")+
        xlab("Age/years") + ylab("")+ ylim(c(90,180))

```

The linear regression model shows a moderately strong correlation with age and weight. For a single-parameter model, (age as sole predictive variable), the predicted values would fall on the blue line. Inclusion of body weight as a second predicitive variable seems to improve the fitted values slightly, as the red dots show.

Also, for 45-year olds the average blood pressure is already well over 120. Some doctors consider this  unhealthy.


For the R specialists, this is the summary of the regression model:

```{r}
summary(bloodpressure_model)

```

```{r}
htmltools::HTML(sprintf('<div class="alert alert-warning">The model predicts that for every year of in a middle-aged person&apos;s life, the systolic blood pressure increases  <b>%s mm Hg/year</b>. That&apos;s almost 9 mm Hg per life decade! Quite a lot. </div>',  round(coef(bloodpressure_model)[2], 3)))
```
Is this realistic? Or  is this a fictitious, simplified, toy-dataset, after all? Is the trend correct, but the value is not? In other words, is the sample nonrepresentative of the population? What is the real importance of the confounding factor, body weight?

Let's try a larger dataset!

#### NHANES dataset

The *NHANES* dataset is available as an R package on [CRAN](https://cran.r-project.org/package=NHANES). It contains data from the US National Health and Nutrition Examination Study. I have used package version 2.1.0, specifically "NHANES 2009-2012 with adjusted weighting". This dataset contains some corrections for undersampling racial minorities. Uncorrected data is also available, in the *NHANESraw* package.



```{r lib, echo=TRUE}
library(NHANES) # Body Shape + related measurements from 10000 US citizens
data(NHANES)

```

The dataset is big, very big. It contains `r nrow(NHANES)` rows and `r ncol(NHANES)` columns. Listing all column definitions here would waste too much screen space. I'll concentrate on the relevant columns here.

Column names containing "Age":

```{r nm}

ages <- names(NHANES) %>% str_which("Age")
names(NHANES)[ages]

```

See [http://www.cdc.gov/nchs/nhanes.htm](http://www.cdc.gov/nchs/nhanes.htm) for details.
Column names containing "Weight":

```{r nm2}
weights <- names(NHANES) %>% 
        str_detect(pattern=regex("weight", ignore_case = TRUE)) %>% which()
names(NHANES)[weights]

```

```{r wghtm, eval=FALSE}
# Column names containing "BMI":
bmi <- names(NHANES) %>% str_which(regex("BMI", ignore_case = TRUE)) 
names(NHANES)[bmi]

```

Column names containing the prefix "BP" (Blood Pressure):

```{r press}
bps <- names(NHANES) %>% str_which("BP")
names(NHANES)[bps]

```
The participants had their Blood Pressure measured up to 3 times. These values were summarized in the *BPSysAve* column.

There are relatively few NA or NULL values in the dataset:

```{r nas, echo=FALSE}
colSums(apply(NHANES[, c(ages[1],weights, bps)], 2, is.na))
```



 Create a smaller NHANES dataset, `bloodpressure2`, containing relevant columns only: 

```{r filt1, echo=TRUE}
bloodpressure2 <- NHANES %>%
    select(BPSysAve, Age, Weight, Gender, BMI) %>%
    filter(!is.na(BPSysAve), !is.na(Weight), !is.na(BMI))

```

The NAs are gone.

We include *Gender* and *BMI* (Body Mass Index) for later. 

The dataset contains `r nrow(bloodpressure2)` rows (People) and `r ncol(bloodpressure2)` columns.

Summary of Blood Pressure Data:

```{r summ1}
summary(bloodpressure2)
```
The maximum value of `r max(bloodpressure2$Age)` for Age actually represents "Adults of age 80 and older". See plots below.

#### Blood Pressure by Gender:

```{r plot1, fig.cap="Blood Pressure by Gender, NHANES Dataset."}
bp2 <- bloodpressure2 %>% 
        select(BPSysAve, Gender) %>% 
        group_by(Gender) %>% 
        summarise(md = median(BPSysAve))

bloodpressure2 %>%
        group_by(Gender) %>% 
        mutate(md = median(BPSysAve)) %>% 
        ungroup() %>% 
        ggplot(aes(BPSysAve, color=Gender, fill=Gender, alpha=0.3)) +
        geom_histogram(binwidth = 1) +
        xlab("Systolic Blood Pressure [mm Hg]") + ylab("") +
        ggtitle("", subtitle = sprintf("Number of People (%s total). Vertical line is median.", nrow(bloodpressure2) )) +
        facet_grid(. ~ Gender) +
        theme(legend.position = "none") +
        geom_vline(aes(xintercept = md, group = Gender), color="orange", size=0.7, alpha=1)

```

Apparently, there is not much difference between the genders, the median BP for women is `r bp2$md[1]`mmHg and for men it is `r bp2$md[2]` mmHg.
Splitting by *age group* reveals a different picture.


#### Blood Pressure by Age Group

After splitting the dataset by life decade, we get this:
```{r labeller}
agegroup_labeller <- function(variable, value) {
  agegroup_str <- str_replace(value, pattern = ",", " - ") %>%
    str_replace_all(pattern = regex("^.|.$"), "") %>%
    str_c(" years")
  agegroup_str
}
```


```{r plot4, fig.height=12, fig.cap="Blood Pressure by Age Group."}
bloodpressure2 %>%
        ggplot(aes(BPSysAve, group=Gender, color=Gender, fill=Gender)) +
        #geom_histogram(binwidth = 1) +
        geom_density(alpha=0.3) +
        
        facet_wrap(~cut_interval(x = Age, length = 10), ncol=1, labeller = agegroup_labeller) +
        ggtitle("Blood Pressure by life decade", subtitle = sprintf("Largest Peaks represent ~ 100 People. Total Number of People: %s.", nrow(bloodpressure2))) +
        xlab("Systolic Blood Pressure [mm Hg]") +
        theme(axis.text.y =  element_blank(),
              panel.grid.minor.x = element_line(color="lightgrey", size=0.1),
              panel.grid.major.x = element_line(color="grey", size=0.1),
              panel.grid.major.y = element_blank())
        


```
For kids below 10 years of age, Blood Pressures (BP) of Boys and Girls are equal. BP values are about 100 mm HG for most both genders. Blood Pressures of teenage boys and 20-30 year-old men are already higher their female "counterparts".
```{r html2}
htmltools::HTML('<div class="alert alert-warning"><b></b>Middle-Aged men generally have higher blood pressures than women of the same age. This remains so until late middle age, when blood pressures of women seem to catch up. The 60-70 year old women have blood pressures just as high as the men; maybe because men with cardiovalscular problems have already died away?</div>')
```


Blood Pressures generally increase, but is this rate really 9 mm/year, as indicated above?

#### Linear modeling

Fit a linear regression model  (Blood Pressure as a function of Age and Body Weight) to the entire `bloodpressure2` subset, just as above for the tiny dataset. 

```{r lm2}
# Fit the model: bloodpressure_model
bloodpressure2_model <- lm(BPSysAve ~ Age + Weight, data = bloodpressure2)

# predict blood pressure using bloodpressure_model :prediction
bloodpressure2$prediction <- predict(bloodpressure2_model, data = bloodpressure2)

```

```{r bpr}
bpr <- round(coef(bloodpressure2_model)[2],3)

htmltools::HTML(sprintf('<div class="alert alert-warning">So the rate is more like <b>%s mm Hg/year.</b> Half as much as for the toy dataset. For data from an equivalent control group (men only, same age) the rate is a bit higher than %s mmHg/yr. (See last figure below)</div>', bpr,  bpr))

```

For the R experts:

```{r lm2summ}
summary(bloodpressure2_model)

```

The significance of Age and Body Weight is very high, but the general correlation is very weak ( R² = `r  summary(bloodpressure2_model)$r.squared`). This can also be seen in the following plots. 

```{r actvspred, fig.cap="Predicted vs Actual Blood Pressure."}
minBP <- min(bloodpressure2$prediction)
ggplot(bloodpressure2, aes(prediction, BPSysAve)) +
  geom_jitter(size=0.1, alpha=0.4) +
  geom_abline(slope = 1, size=2, alpha=.4,
              color = "dodgerblue") +
        xlim(c(minBP, 150)) +
        xlab("Systolic Blood Pressure, predicted from Age and Weight alone [mmHg]") +
        ylim(c(minBP, 150)) +
        ggtitle("Predicted vs Actual Blood Pressure",
                subtitle = "mm Hg")

```

Light blue line is the 1:1 line. No systematic under- or overestimation here.

Predicted values of the full model fall short of capturing the variability in the data. Maybe other factors have to taken into into account (but not in this blogpost).

```{r agepl, fig.cap="Blood Pressure as a function of Age and Weight.  Predicted values are shown in red, observed values in black. Blue line is BP predicted a function of Age alone."}
###############################################

# Age-related plots
ggplot(bloodpressure2, aes(Age, BPSysAve)) +
  geom_jitter(size=0.1, alpha=0.4) +
  geom_abline(slope = coef(bloodpressure2_model)[2], 
              intercept = coef(bloodpressure2_model)[1], 
              size=2, alpha=.4, color = "dodgerblue") +
  geom_point(aes(Age, prediction), color = "red", size = 0.6)+
        ggtitle("Blood Pressure predicted by Age and Weight",
                subtitle = sprintf("mm Hg.  NHANES dataset, %s people.", nrow(bloodpressure2)))

```

Maybe we need to split by Age-Class again?

#### Boxplots of Blood Pressures of 10-year age groups

```{r Boxplots, fig.cap="Blood Pressure by Age group. Orange Symbols are sample mean and lower and upper Gaussian confidence limits based on the t-distribution."}
ggplot(bloodpressure2, aes(cut_interval(x = Age, length = 10), BPSysAve)) +
  #geom_boxplot(varwidth = TRUE,  outlier.shape = NA) +
  geom_violin(alpha = 0.1, aes(color = Gender, fill=Gender, alpha=0.3), size=0.5) +
  theme(legend.position = "none") +
  stat_summary(fun.data = "mean_cl_normal", 
               geom = "crossbar",
               width = 0.2,
               col = "orange") +
  scale_y_continuous(limits = c(75, 225), 
                     breaks = seq(80, 220, 20), 
                     minor_breaks = seq(80, 220, 10)) +
  theme(axis.text.x = element_text(angle=60, vjust=0.5, hjust=0.5),
        panel.grid.major.y = element_line(color="lightgrey", size=0.2),
        panel.grid.minor.y = element_line(color="lightgrey", linetype = "dotted")) +
  xlab("Age group [years]") +
  ylab("Blood Pressure [mmHg]") +
  ggtitle("", subtitle = sprintf("Systolic Blood Pressure [mmHg]. NHANES Dataset, 2009-2012. n= %s people.", nrow(bloodpressure2) )) +
  facet_grid(. ~ Gender )


```

Note that this plot is essentially the same as Figure 3, only the density plots are rotated 90 degrees.

Comparing this with Figure 1, the toy dataset, I think the violin plot above shows that it is the Blood Pressures from the *female subgroup* that increase linearly with age.  Blood Pressure of men has already increased earlier, in their twenties. Men generally have "unhealthier" values also for body weight, annd do so at earlier ages (BMI distributions by age group not shown).

#### Comparing myself with men of similar age, weight and BMI 

In the last years my weight was between 70 and 80 Kilos, and I was always slightly  to moderately overweight, so let's say my [Body Mass Index](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:BMI_chart.svg) varied between 25  to 30.

Let's build a new dataset `bloodpressure3` similar to the toy dataset from Figure 1, but with data from real people.
We'll use our subset `bloodpressure2` from the NHANES data, by filtering with these citeria:

```{r bp3, echo=TRUE}
bloodpressure3 <- bloodpressure2 %>% 
        filter(BMI >= 25 , BMI <=30,
               Weight >=70, Weight <= 80, 
               Gender == "male", 
               Age >= 45 ) %>% 
        select(-Gender)

summary(bloodpressure3)        
```

```{r bpplot, fig.cap="Blood pressure as a function of age and body weight. NHANES data filtered to match age-range of Figure 1, and my own  BMI- and weight-range. Red dots are predicted values by the two-regressor model."}

bloodpressure3_model <- lm(BPSysAve ~ Age + Weight, data = bloodpressure3)
bloodpressure3$Predictions <- predict(bloodpressure3_model)
dashed_line <- bloodpressure %>% arrange(age) %>% select(age, prediction) %>% head(1) %>% 
        union_all(bloodpressure %>% 
                          arrange(age) %>% select(age, prediction) %>% tail(1)        
) %>% rename("Age"="age", "BPSysAve"="prediction")

ggplot(bloodpressure3, aes(Age, BPSysAve)) +
  geom_point() +
  geom_smooth(method="lm") +
  geom_point(aes(Age, Predictions), color = "red", size = 1) +
        ggtitle(sprintf("Blood pressures of %s middle-aged US men (70-80 kg)", nrow(bloodpressure3)), 
                subtitle="Systolic Blood pressure [mm Hg]. Note age-range on x-axis.")+
        xlab("Age/years") + ylab("")  +
        scale_x_continuous(limits = c(45,75), 
                     breaks = seq(45,75,5), 
                     minor_breaks = seq(45,75,5)) +
        geom_point(data=data.frame(Age=48, BPSysAve=110), 
                   aes(Age, BPSysAve), color="green", size=3, fill="navy") +
        geom_line(data=dashed_line,
                    color="blue", linetype="dashed")
        

```

The solid blue line shows the predictions by age alone. The slope is `r coef(bloodpressure3_model)[2]` mmHg/yr, much lower than the slope in Figure 1 which was  `r coef(bloodpressure_model)[2]`. The equivalent regression line from Figure 1 is shown as a dashed blue line.

The green dot shows my personal Age/BP data at the time of writing .

```{r bp3summ}
summary(bloodpressure3_model)
```
