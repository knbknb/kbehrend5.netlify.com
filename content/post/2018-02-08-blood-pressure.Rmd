#### Blood Pressure as a function of age and body weight


```{r abstr, echo=FALSE}
htmltools::HTML('<div class="alert alert-info"><b>Basic analysis of two health datasets from ~ 2010, about the general US Population, and myself.</b>
The datasets were gathered independently. One of them is a tiny teaching dataset, the other is a larger medical study. Both datasets show a trend: systolic blood pressure rises about 5-10 mm Hg per decade of a person&apos;s life. The correlation is weak, though; and aging is not the cause for high blood pressure.</div>')
```

Recently, conversations with friends and colleagues  had me  thinking about blood pressure.
Then I've remembered that weekend project from late 2017. Back then I had briefly analysed two datasets: one available [on the internet](http://college.cengage.com/mathematics/brase/understandable_statistics/7e/students/datasets/mlr/excel/mlr02.xls), the other available as R package [NHANES on CRAN](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/NHANES/index.html). 

My motivation for writing this up was (1) learning more tricks with visualization library *ggplot*, and more importantly, (2) gaining insights from a real study that interests me. It was also a helpful strategy to start with a hypothesis derived from a small teaching-dataset, then switch to a messier, larger dataset: a real medical study with data from 10000 people.

#### Preprocessing 

Load the necessary packages. Nothing fancy here.

```{r pkgs, echo=TRUE, cache=FALSE}
library(readxl) # for mlr02.xls from http://college.cengage.com/  
library(tidyverse)
library(NHANES) # Body Shape + related measurements from 10000 US citizens
data(NHANES)
```

```{r theme}
library(ggthemes)
#theme_set(theme_economist_white()) # unreliable
theme_set(theme_bw())
scale_colour_discrete <- function(...) scale_color_brewer(palette="Set1")
```

Download **dataset 1**: A tiny 11*4 table called `Systolic Blood Pressure`. It comes from [a book publisher's website](http://college.cengage.com/mathematics/brase/understandable_statistics/7e/students/datasets/mlr/frames/frame.html). Maybe it is a teaching dataset; perhaps it is supplementary material for a college textbook.

The [markdown version  of this blog post](https://github.com/knbknb/kbehrends.netlify.com/blob/master/content/post/2018-02-08-blood-pressure.Rmd) contains the necessary instructions on how to download and import the data.

```{r IOstuff, echo=FALSE}
xlsurl <- "http://college.cengage.com/mathematics/brase/understandable_statistics/7e/students/datasets/mlr/excel/mlr02.xls"
xls <- basename(xlsurl)
folder <- "data_private"
destfile <- here::here(file.path(folder, xls))
destfile2 <- here::here(file.path(folder, "mlr02.csv"))

if (!file.exists(destfile)) {
  download.file(xlsurl, destfile = destfile, method = "curl")
  xlstmp <- read_xls(destfile)
  # col1 = systolic blood pressure
  # col2 = age in years
  # col3 = weight in pounds
  # TODO: document how converted to csv
}
# read in a properly formatted csv file
bloodpressure <- read_csv(destfile2, col_names = TRUE)
# Convert bodyweights from pounts to kilograms:
bloodpressure <- bloodpressure %>%
  mutate(weight = weight_pounds * 0.453592)

```

#### Dataset 1

The dataset is tiny:

```{r ds1, echo=FALSE}
glimpse(bloodpressure)
```

```{r echo=FALSE, eval=FALSE}
# The summary takes up more room than the data itself.
summary(bloodpressure)
```

We can plot it in its entirety. I also fit a simple linear regression model to the data: Blood Pressure as a function of a person's age and body weight.

```{r tiny1,  results='hide'}
bloodpressure_model <- lm(blood_pressure ~ age * weight, data = bloodpressure)


# predict blood pressure using bloodpressure_model :prediction
bloodpressure$prediction <- predict(bloodpressure_model, data = bloodpressure)


```

Adding the predictions from the model to the plot:

```{r tiny2, echo=FALSE, fig.cap=" Predicted values are shown in red, observed values in black."}

ggplot(bloodpressure, aes(age, blood_pressure)) +
  geom_point() +
  geom_smooth(method="lm") +
  geom_point(aes(age, prediction), color = "red", size = 1) +
        ggtitle("Blood pressure as a function of age and body weight.", subtitle="Systolic Blood pressure [mm Hg]. Note age-range on x-axis.")+
        xlab("Age/years") + ylab("")+ ylim(c(90,180))

```

The linear regression model shows a strong correlation of blood pressure with age and weight. For a single-parameter model, (age as sole predictive variable), the predicted values would fall on the blue line. Inclusion of body weight as a second predictive variable seems to improve the fitted values slightly, as the red dots show.

Also, for 45-year olds the average blood pressure is already well over 120. 


For the R specialists, this is the summary of the regression model:

```{r}
summary(bloodpressure_model)

```

```{r}
htmltools::HTML(sprintf('<div class="alert alert-warning">The model predicts that for every year of in a middle-aged person&apos;s life, the systolic blood pressure increases  <b>%s mm Hg/year</b>. That&apos;s almost 9 mm Hg per life decade! Quite a lot. </div>',  round(coef(bloodpressure_model)[2], 3)))
```
Is this realistic? Or is this a fictitious, simplified, toy-dataset, after all? Is the trend correct, but the value is not? In other words, is the sample nonrepresentative of the population? What is the real importance of the confounding factor, body weight?

Let's try a larger dataset!

#### NHANES dataset

The *NHANES* dataset is available as an R package on [CRAN](https://cran.r-project.org/package=NHANES). It contains data from the US National Health and Nutrition Examination Study. I have used package version 2.1.0, specifically "NHANES 2009-2012 with adjusted weighting". This dataset contains some corrections for undersampling racial minorities. Uncorrected data is also available, in the *NHANESraw* package.




The dataset is big, very big. It contains `r nrow(NHANES)` rows (People, anonymized) and `r ncol(NHANES)` columns (features). Listing all column definitions here would waste too much screen space. See [http://www.cdc.gov/nchs/nhanes.htm](http://www.cdc.gov/nchs/nhanes.htm) for details. I'll concentrate on the relevant columns:

Column names containing "Age":

```{r nm}

ages <- names(NHANES) %>% str_which("Age")
names(NHANES)[ages]

```


Column names containing "Weight":

```{r nm2}
weights <- names(NHANES) %>% 
        str_detect(pattern=regex("weight", ignore_case = TRUE)) %>% which()
names(NHANES)[weights]

```

```{r wghtm, eval=FALSE}
# Column names containing "BMI":
bmi <- names(NHANES) %>% str_which(regex("BMI", ignore_case = TRUE)) 
names(NHANES)[bmi]

```

Column names containing the prefix "BP" (Blood Pressure):

```{r press}
bps <- names(NHANES) %>% str_which("BP")
names(NHANES)[bps]

```
The participants had their Blood Pressure measured up to 3 times. These values were summarized in the *BPSysAve* column.

There are relatively few NA or NULL values in the dataset:

```{r nas, echo=FALSE}
colSums(apply(NHANES[, c(ages[1],weights, bps)], 2, is.na))
```



 Create a smaller NHANES dataset, `bloodpressure2`, containing relevant columns only: 

```{r filt1, echo=TRUE}
bloodpressure2 <- NHANES %>%
    select(BPSysAve, Age, AgeDecade, Weight, Gender, BMI) %>%
    filter(!is.na(BPSysAve), !is.na(Weight), !is.na(BMI))

```

The NAs are gone.

We include *Gender* and *BMI* (Body Mass Index) for later. 

The reduced dataset contains `r nrow(bloodpressure2)` rows (People) and `r ncol(bloodpressure2)` columns.

Summary of Blood Pressure Data:

```{r summ1}
summary(bloodpressure2)
```
The maximum value of `r max(bloodpressure2$Age)` for Age actually represents "Adults of age 80 and older". See plots below.

#### Blood Pressure by Gender:

```{r plot2, fig.cap="Blood Pressure by Gender, NHANES Dataset."}
# only used for inline r expr
bp2 <- bloodpressure2 %>% 
        select(BPSysAve, Gender) %>% 
        group_by(Gender) %>% 
        summarise(md = median(BPSysAve))

bloodpressure2 %>%
        group_by(Gender) %>% 
        mutate(md = median(BPSysAve)) %>% 
        ungroup() %>% 
        ggplot(aes(BPSysAve, color=NULL, fill=Gender)) +
        geom_histogram(binwidth = 1, alpha=0.6) +
        xlab("Systolic Blood Pressure [mm Hg]") + ylab("") +
        ggtitle("", subtitle = sprintf("Number of People (%s total). Vertical line is median.", nrow(bloodpressure2) )) +
        facet_grid(. ~ Gender) +
        theme(legend.position = "none") + 
        geom_vline(aes(xintercept = md, group = Gender, color=Gender) , size=0.7, alpha=1)

```

Apparently, there is not much difference between the genders, the median BP for women is `r bp2$md[1]`mmHg and for men it is `r bp2$md[2]` mmHg.
Splitting by *age group* reveals a different picture.


#### Blood Pressure by Age Group

After splitting the dataset by life decade, we get this:
```{r labeller, eval=FALSE}
agegroup_labeller <- function(variable, value) {
  agegroup_str <- str_replace(value, pattern = ",", " - ") %>%
    str_replace_all(pattern = regex("^.|.$"), "") %>%
    str_replace_all(pattern = regex("80"), "80+") %>%
    str_c(" years")
  agegroup_str
}
```


```{r plot3, fig.height=12, fig.cap="Blood Pressure by Age Group."}
bloodpressure2 %>%
        ggplot(aes(BPSysAve, group=Gender, color=Gender, fill=Gender)) +
        #geom_histogram(binwidth = 1) +
        geom_density(alpha=0.3) +
        facet_wrap(~AgeDecade, ncol=1) +
        ggtitle("Blood Pressure by life decade", subtitle = sprintf("Largest Peaks represent ~ 100 People. Total Number of People: %s.", nrow(bloodpressure2))) +
        xlab("Systolic Blood Pressure [mm Hg]") +
        theme(plot.background = element_rect(fill="white"),
                #axis.text.y =  element_blank(),
              panel.grid.minor.x = element_line(color="lightgrey", size=0.1),
              panel.grid.major.x = element_line(color="grey", size=0.1),
              panel.grid.major.y = element_blank()) +
        scale_x_continuous(limits = c(70, 220), 
                     breaks = seq(70, 220, 10), 
                     minor_breaks = seq(70, 220, 10))
        


```

For kids below 10 years of age, Blood Pressures (BP) of boys and girls are equal. The majority of BP values are about 100 mm Hg, for both genders. Blood Pressures of teenage boys and 20-30 year-old men are already higher than their female "counterparts". 

(Originally I made the above plot with BMI data instead of BP. This was also very informative, especially the multimodal density plots of "young people" agegroups, but I'll focus on BP here.)

```{r html2}
htmltools::HTML('<div class="alert alert-warning"><b></b>Middle-aged men generally have higher blood pressures than women of the same age. This remains so until late middle age, when blood pressures of women seem to catch up. The 60-70 year old women have blood pressures just as high as the men; maybe the men with cardiovascular problems  (having higher blood pressures, at young age) have already died away?</div>')
```


Blood Pressures generally increase over the years, but is this rate *really* 9 mm/year, as indicated above in Fig.1?

#### Linear modeling

Fit a linear regression model  (Blood Pressure as a function of Age and Body Weight) to the entire `bloodpressure2` subset, just as above for the tiny dataset. 

```{r lm2}
# Fit the model: bloodpressure_model
#bloodpressure2_model <- lm(BPSysAve ~ Age + Weight, data = bloodpressure2)
bloodpressure2_model <- lm(BPSysAve ~ Age + Weight, data = bloodpressure2)
bloodpressure2_model_interact <- lm(BPSysAve ~ Age * Weight, data = bloodpressure2)

# predict blood pressure using bloodpressure_model :prediction
bloodpressure2$prediction  <- predict(bloodpressure2_model, data = bloodpressure2)
bloodpressure2$prediction_ia <- predict(bloodpressure2_model_interact, data = bloodpressure2)
```
I have included the interaction term `age:weight` because from experience it makes sense: older bodies metabolize more differently, and thus at each age the human body has different rates of gaining weight.

```{r bpr}
bpr <- round(coef(bloodpressure2_model)[2],3)

htmltools::HTML(sprintf('<div class="alert alert-warning">There is a trend: systolic blood pressure increases with age. The rate is about <b>%s mm Hg/year.</b> Half as much as for the toy dataset. For data from a group <i>similar to me</i> (men only, 45+ yrs, 70-80 kg) the rate is ~6 mmHg/decade, a bit higher than %s mmHg/decade. (See below)</div>', bpr,  round(10*bpr,1)))

```

For the R experts:

```{r lm2summ}
summary(bloodpressure2_model_interact)

```


The significance of Age and Body Weight is very high, but the general correlation is weak ( R² = `r  summary(bloodpressure2_model)$r.squared`). This can also be seen in the following plots. 

```{r actvspred, fig.cap="Predicted vs Measured Blood Pressure."}
minBP <- min(bloodpressure2$prediction)

ggplot(bloodpressure2, aes(prediction, BPSysAve)) +
        geom_density2d(aes(alpha=0.4)) +
  geom_jitter(size=0.1, alpha=0.4) +
  geom_abline(slope = 1, size=0.5, alpha=.6,
              color = "black") +
        xlab("Systolic Blood Pressure, predicted from Age and Weight alone [mmHg]") +
        ylim(c(minBP, 150)) +
        ggtitle("Predicted vs Measured Blood Pressure",
                subtitle =sprintf("Average Systolic Blood Pressure, mm Hg, %s people", nrow(bloodpressure2)) ) +
        theme(panel.grid.major.x = element_line(color="lightgrey", linetype = "solid"),
              legend.position="none") +
        scale_x_continuous(limits = c(100, 150), 
                     breaks = seq(100, 150, 10), 
                     minor_breaks = seq(100, 150, 10))
```

The back diagonal line is the 1:1 line. Blue isolines indicate statistical density.

Predicted values of the full model fall short of capturing the variability in the data. Maybe other factors have to be taken into into account (but not in this blogpost).

```{r agepl, fig.cap="Blood Pressure as a function of Age and Weight.  Predicted values are shown in pink/red, observed values in black. Blue line is BP predicted a function of Age alone. Black line is BP modeled with weight/age interaction effect."}
###############################################

# Age-related plots
ggplot(bloodpressure2, aes(Age, BPSysAve)) +
  geom_jitter(size=0.1, alpha=0.4) +
  geom_abline(slope = coef(bloodpressure2_model)[2], 
        intercept = coef(bloodpressure2_model)[1], 
        size=2, alpha=.4, color = "dodgerblue") +
  geom_point(aes(Age, prediction), color = "pink", size = 0.6, shape=21)+
  geom_point(aes(Age, prediction_ia), color = "red", size = 0.3, shape=22)+
  geom_smooth(aes(Age, prediction), color="navy", size=0.2, method="lm", se=0) +        
  ggtitle("Blood Pressure predicted by Age and Weight",
        subtitle = sprintf("mm Hg.  NHANES dataset, %s people. Pink dots: weight only. Red dots: weight + weight-age interaction included", nrow(bloodpressure2)))

```
In the plot above, *pink symbols* are predicted values from age and weight *without interaction*, whereas *red* symbols  represent predictions which *include an interaction term* between age and weight. The interaction term seems to become increasingly more relevant with higher ages, changing the sign of the effect size. Honestly, I am  [not sure what I am looking at here](https://stats.stackexchange.com/questions/5450/what-if-interaction-wipes-out-my-direct-effects-in-regression).  

Maybe we need to split by age group again?

#### Boxplots of Blood Pressures of 10-year age groups

```{r Boxplots, fig.cap="Blood Pressure by Age group. Orange Symbols are sample means."}
ggplot(bloodpressure2, aes(cut_interval(x = Age, length = 10), BPSysAve)) +

  ylab("Blood Pressure [mmHg]") +
  ggtitle("", subtitle = sprintf("Systolic Blood Pressure [mmHg]. NHANES Dataset, 2009-2012. n= %s people.", nrow(bloodpressure2) )) +
  facet_grid(. ~ Gender )


```

Note that this plot is essentially the same as Figure 3, only the density plots are rotated 90 degrees.

Comparing this with Figure 1, the toy dataset, I think the violin plot above shows that it is the Blood Pressures from the *female subgroup* that increase linearly with age.  Blood Pressure of men has already increased earlier, in their twenties. Men generally have "unhealthier" values also for body weight, and do so at earlier ages (again: informative BMI distributions by age group not shown).

#### Comparing myself with men of similar age, weight and BMI 

In the last years my weight was between 70 and 80 Kilos, and I was always slightly  to moderately overweight, so let's say my [Body Mass Index](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:BMI_chart.svg) varied between 25  to 30.

Let's build a new dataset `bloodpressure3` similar to the toy dataset from Figure 1, but with data from real people.
We'll use our subset `bloodpressure2` from the NHANES data, by filtering with these citeria:

```{r bp3, echo=TRUE}
bloodpressure3 <- bloodpressure2 %>% 
        filter(BMI >= 25 , BMI <=30,
               Weight >=70, Weight <= 80, 
               Gender == "male", 
               Age >= 45 ) %>% 
        select(-Gender, -prediction)

bloodpressure3_model <- lm(BPSysAve ~ Age * Weight, data = bloodpressure3) #
bloodpressure3$Predictions <- predict(bloodpressure3_model) # same data

summary(bloodpressure3)        
```

```{r bpplot, fig.cap="Blood pressure as a function of age and body weight. NHANES data filtered to match age-range of Figure 1, and my own  BMI- and weight-range. Red dots are predicted values by the two-regressor model."}


# for dashed blue line, include data from toy dataset. here new column is called "prediction
dashed_line <- bloodpressure %>% arrange(age) %>% select(age, prediction) %>% head(1) %>% 
        union_all(bloodpressure %>% 
                          arrange(age) %>% select(age, prediction) %>% tail(1)        
) %>% rename("Age"="age", "BPSysAve" = "prediction")

knbdoc <- data.frame(Age=48, BPSysAve=110) # doctor visits
knbdev <- data.frame(BPSysAve=c(137, 134, 124,113,119,98,126, 124,132,183, 126, 135, 123,124,115, 138, 118, 120, 118, 132, 123, 104, 119, 118, 94)) # my own device
set.seed(48)
knbdev$Age= sample(46:48, nrow(knbdev) , replace = TRUE)
ggplot(bloodpressure3, aes(Age, BPSysAve)) +
  geom_point() +
  geom_smooth(method="lm") +
  geom_point(aes(Age, Predictions), color = "red", size = 1) +
        ggtitle(sprintf("Blood pressures of %s US men (45-80+ years, 70-80 kg), and myself", nrow(bloodpressure3)), 
                subtitle="Systolic Blood pressure [mm Hg]. Note age-range on x-axis. Large green dot is my blood pressure, during doctor visits.")+
        xlab("Age/years") + ylab("")  +
        scale_x_continuous(limits = c(45,82), 
                     breaks = seq(45,75,5), 
                     minor_breaks = seq(45,75,5)) +
        geom_point(data=knbdoc, 
                   aes(Age, BPSysAve), color="green", size=3, fill="navy") +
        geom_line(data=dashed_line,
                    color="blue", linetype="dashed") +
        geom_jitter(data=knbdev, color="darkgreen", size=0.2) +
  geom_density2d(data=knbdev, alpha=0.4, color="darkgreen")
        

```

The solid blue line shows the predictions by age alone. The slope is `r coef(bloodpressure3_model)[2]` mmHg/yr, much lower than the slope in Figure 1 which was  `r coef(bloodpressure_model)[2]`. The equivalent regression line from Figure 1 is shown as a dashed blue line.

The large green dot shows my personal Age/BP data, measured 2014-2017 by my doctor, as far I remember it (always BP = 110 mmHg). Tiny dark green dots and isolines represent BP values stored on my own BP measurement device which might have been used on other family members (I don't remember).

For the R experts:

```{r bp3summ}
