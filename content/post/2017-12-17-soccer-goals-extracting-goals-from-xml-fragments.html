<p>This is part 2 of a 3-part series about my first attempts at Bayesian Analysis of Soccer data.</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="/post/2017/12/soccerdb-schema-diagrams/">Part 1</a> shows the database diagram of the Sqlite database mentioned below.</li>
<li>Part 2 (this page) describes how to preprocess some text data that was stored in an cryptic format inside the database</li>
<li>Part 3 (not written yet) describes some statistical analysis of some aspect of this dataset.</li>
</ul>
<div id="dataset" class="section level4">
<h4>Dataset</h4>
<p>The dataset used here is the <a href="https://www.kaggle.com/hugomathien/soccer/">“European Soccer Database” - 25k+ matches, players &amp; teams attributes for European Professional Football</a> from Kaggle.com. This dataset is delivered as an Sqlite database. It contains 7 tables which have been filled by the original curator in 2014-2016. The data comes from many sources.</p>
</div>
<div id="the-problem" class="section level4">
<h4>The problem</h4>
<p>The problem I am solving here: Important information is stored inside the database, but in format that is not usable.</p>
<p>The goal data looks like this:</p>
<pre class="r"><code>library(DBI)
con &lt;- dbConnect(odbc::odbc(), &quot;well-sqlite-footballdb&quot;)</code></pre>
<p>For the sake of brevity, to see the R packages I’ve included to process the data, see the <a href="/post/2017/11/european-soccer-players-and-their-bmi/">previous blogpost</a>. Only the <code>tidyr</code> package is new here.</p>
<pre class="r"><code>library(tidyr)   # gather</code></pre>
<p>The database consists of 7 tables. We’ll read in all of them. The Player table contains basic data of ~10000 soccer players from the top leagues of 14 European countries. They are not strictly “European soccer players”, but players from all over the globe, competing in the top leagues of certain Western European countries.</p>
