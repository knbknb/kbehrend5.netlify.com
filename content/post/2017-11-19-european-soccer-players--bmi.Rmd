### Playing with a Soccer Database from Kaggle.com

This post is also available - maybe in a better, more readable version at [my Github Repo for this site](https://github.com/knbknb/kbehrend5.netlify.com/blob/master/content/blog/2019-11-19-european-soccer-players--bmi.md).

My blog: <a href="https://kbehrend5.netlify.com">https://kbehrend5.netlify.com</a>.

Recently I've downloaded as a [zipfile (36 MB)](https://www.kaggle.com/hugomathien/soccer/downloads/soccer.zip) from data science community [Kaggle.com](https://www.kaggle.com/hugomathien/soccer).


This zipfile contains a single file, a 313 MB sqlite Database. Let's take a peek what's inside:

Create connection to football DB

```{r DBI, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}

library(DBI)
con <- dbConnect(odbc::odbc(), "well-sqlite-footballdb")

```

Read in R packages  necessary to load the data: 
```{r message=FALSE, warning=FALSE, results='hide'}
# tidyverse packages
library(dplyr, warn.conflicts = FALSE) # 
library(purrr)   # functional programming
library(stringr)
library(lubridate) # strings to datetime
library(ggplot2)

theme_set(theme_bw())

```

The database consists of 7 tables. We'll read in all of them although we need only one, the Player table, which contains basic data of ~10000 soccer players from the top leagues of 14 European countries. They are not strictly "European soccer players", but players from all over the globe, competing in the European Leagues.

```{r}
table_names <- dbListTables(con)

good <- !  str_detect(table_names, "sqlite_sequence")
table_names <- table_names[good]

# Import all tables as data frames, 308MB
# feasible with lots of RAM
walk(table_names,function(x) assign(x, 
                                    dbReadTable(x, conn=con),
                                    envir = globalenv()))
dbDisconnect(con)


```

Tables in the Sqlite database:

```{r tables, echo=FALSE, results='hide'}

tab <- data.frame(Rows=map_dbl(table_names, ~nrow(get(.))))
tab2 <- data.frame(Rows=map_dbl(table_names, ~ncol(get(.))))
colnames(tab2) <- "Columns"
tab <- cbind(tab, tab2)
rownames(tab) <- table_names

```
```{r echo=FALSE}
tab
```


The `Player` table lists the soccer players' weights in pounds, and their height in Centimeters. I don't know how the people who compiled the database obtained the weight data, but I think FIFA requires it for their records.
We'll calculate [Body Mass Index](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Body_mass_index), (bmi) for each player which is defined as

```{r results='hide', echo=FALSE}
# if need be, read in single table - again
#Player <- con %>%  DBI::dbReadTable("Player")
#Match  <-  con %>%  DBI::dbReadTable("Match")

```

$$\mbox{Body Mass Index }{bmi}=\frac{height}{weight^2}$$
and has `m/kg^2` as the unit of measure, but we'll omit this from now on.

We'll also create three size classes, large players who are taller than 1.90 m, 'medium' size players who are between 1.75 and 1.90 m tall, and 'small' players who are less than 1.75m.

```{r player, results='hide'}
pounds_per_kg <- 0.453592

sizes <- c("large" = 190, "small" = 175)
Player %<>%
  mutate(birthday = ymd(as_datetime(birthday))) %>% # was string
  mutate(weight = weight * pounds_per_kg) %>%
  mutate(bmi = weight /((height/100)^2)) %>%
  mutate(size = factor(
          if_else(height >= sizes["large"], "large", 
          if_else(height >= sizes["small"], "medium", "small"))))
  
```

I'll also focus  on the "large" class of players mentioned below, because the players are  more well-known, at least in Germany.

Calculate a few values to make plots below more informative:

```{r}
range_bmi <- Player %>%  select(bmi) %>% range()
med_bmi <- median(Player$bmi)

diff_bmi  <- range_bmi %>% diff() %>% ceiling()
rng_seas  <- range(Match$season)
np        <- nrow(Player)
```

Display raw histogram with absolute counts:

```{r playerclasses_stacked}

# function common to most plots
decorate <- function(x) {
  list(
    ggtitle(
      "Body Mass Index of Soccer Players",
      subtitle = sprintf("%s Players from Europe's Top Leagues, 2008-2016", x)
    ),
    xlab("Player Body Mass Index"),
    theme(legend.justification = c(1.25, 0.95), legend.position = c(1, 0.95)),
    scale_fill_discrete(
      name = "Player Height",
      labels = c(
        sprintf(
          "> %s cm)",
          sizes["large"]
        ),
        sprintf(">= %s cm)", sizes["small"]),
        sprintf("< %s cm)", sizes["small"])
      )
    )
  )
}
Player %>%
  ggplot(aes(bmi, fill=size)) + 
    geom_histogram(alpha=0.5, bins = diff_bmi*2) +
    decorate(np) +
    geom_vline(xintercept=med_bmi, size=0.3, 
               color="darkgrey") +
    annotate(geom = "text", x = 20, y = 1690, 
           label = sprintf("median BMI: %.1f ->", med_bmi), 
           color="darkgrey") +
    geom_vline(xintercept=25.5, size=0.3, color="darkgrey") +
    annotate(geom = "text", x = 27.5, y = 750, 
           label = sprintf("<- BMI %.1f:\n \"overweight\"", 25.5), 
           color="darkgrey")

```


Who are the largest players with the highest BMI?

```{r}
players_large <- Player %>%
  filter(size == "large") %>%
  arrange(desc(bmi))

# Top 6 PLayers
(players_large_top <- players_large %>% 
                select(player_name, birthday, height, weight, bmi) %>% 
                head())

```

Here I look up some more info about these high-BMI players. I'll use my own (hidden) magic R function `kgapi_lookup_kv()` that looks up terms in the [Google Knowledge Graph](https://www.google.com/intl/bn/insidesearch/features/search/knowledge.html) API which contains a large fraction of Wikipedia data, as a Linked-Data version. 



```{r results='hide'}
players_large_top_kg <- map(players_large_top$player_name, 
                            kgapi_lookup_kv)
```

Processing the column names is a bit messy, so this will not be shown here.

```{r results='hide', echo=FALSE, comment="intermediate, messy calculations"}

w <- players_large_top_kg %>%  
  map_df(tidyr::spread, key="key", value="value")  
w["result..type"] <- NULL
w["result.url"] <- NULL
w <- map_df(w, unlist)
colnames(w) <- str_replace(colnames(w), "result\\.+", "")
colnames(w) <- str_replace(colnames(w), "detailedDescription\\.+", "")
players_large_top_detail <- w %>% 
  select(name, description, long_description=articleBody, url=image.url) %>%    
  mutate(long_description = 
                 str_replace_all(long_description, "\\.\\s.*", ".")) %>%
  inner_join(players_large_top, by=c("name" = "player_name")) %>%
  mutate(Name =str_c("[", name, "](", url, ")")) %>% 
  select(Name, BMI=bmi, description, long_description) %>% 
  arrange(desc(BMI))
#players_large_top_detail

```

End result, see Table 1:

```{r table1, echo=FALSE}
capstr <- "Table 1: Soccer players over 190 size 
ranked by Body Mass Index, BMI. 
(source: Kaggle Dataset, Wikipedia via Google Knowledge Graph API)"
knitr::kable(players_large_top_detail, 
             caption = capstr, col.names = c("Player Name", "BMI", "Short Desc", "Long Description"),
             table.attr = "id=\"mytable\"",
             row.names = FALSE,  format = "markdown" )

```


```{r wiese, echo=FALSE, results='hide'}
wiese_bmi <- players_large %>% 
        filter(player_name == "Tim Wiese") %>%  select(bmi)
```

Surprisingly, German goalie [Tim Wiese](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tim_Wiese) has the highest BMI. His career in the Bundesliga has ended, but he made some headlines in 2014-2016 because did bodybuilding, an tried -temporarily- to pursue a career in Wrestling.

His BMI is `r sprintf("%.1f", wiese_bmi)` m/kg². How large an outlier is this? Let's plot some histograms:



```{r histogram_all}
vlines <- map(players_large_top_detail[, "BMI"], c) %>%  unlist()
Player %>%
  ggplot(aes(bmi, fill=size)) +
  geom_vline(xintercept = vlines, linetype="dotted") +
  geom_histogram(aes(y = ..density..), alpha=0.5, bins = diff_bmi *3) +
  decorate(np)

```


In the plot above, the BMIs of the players of table 1 are shown as dotted lines.



```{r histogram_facets}


dnorm_fit <- MASS::fitdistr(Player$bmi, densfun = "normal")

Player %>%
  ggplot(aes(bmi, fill = size)) +
  geom_density(alpha = 0.5) +
  stat_function(
    fun = function(x) dnorm(x, 
                            dnorm_fit$estimate["mean"], 
                            dnorm_fit$estimate["sd"]),
    color = "red",
    size = 0.5
  ) +
  ggtitle(
    "Body Mass Index of Soccer Players",
    subtitle = sprintf(
      "%s Players from Europe's Top Leagues, 
      2008-2016. Mean BMI = %.1f m/kg², std.dev = %.1f",
      np, dnorm_fit$estimate["mean"], dnorm_fit$estimate["sd"]
    )
  ) +
  xlab("Player Body Mass Index") +
  # geom_vline(xintercept=dnorm_fit$estimate["mean"], color="red", size=0.2) +
  facet_wrap(~ size) +
  theme(legend.position = "none")

```



So we see that the BMI of soccer players in the top European Leagues fits pretty well a normal distribution with parameters mean = `r round(dnorm_fit$estimate["mean"], 1)` and standard deviation =  `r round(dnorm_fit$estimate["sd"],1)`.
