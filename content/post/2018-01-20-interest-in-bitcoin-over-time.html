<div class="alert alert-info"><b>Bitcoin:</b>
Visualizing (1) Wikipedia Pageviews, (2) Google Searches and (3) Exchange Rates from 2015 to early 2018. 
Simple timeseries plots (created from Web-API data) show that these three are strongly correlated, except when they aren't.
</div>
<p>In this post I’ll analyse global interest in <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bitcoin">Bitcoin</a> and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ethereum">Ethereum</a> over time, according to accesses to their Wikipedia articles and as Google Searches.</p>
<p>The end of the year 2017 saw the “Bitcoin <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/audio/2017-03-31/this-is-how-you-know-when-the-stock-market-is-in-a-bubble">Bubble</a>”, a period of one month where 1 Bitcoin was traded for up to $20000 on most exchanges. I am not invested in Bitcoin, and never was substantially, but cryptocurrencies and the blockchain technology still interest me.</p>

<h3>Preprocessing</h3>
<p>Preprocessing entails:</p>
<ul>
<li>Define necessary R packages</li>
<li>Fetching the data</li>
</ul>
<p>At this time, no user registration process is required to get to the data. No API keys and authentication steps are necessary to call the Web-APIs mentioned below.</p>
<div id="load-r-packages" class="section level4">
<h4>Load R packages</h4>
<pre class="r"><code>library(pageviews) # access Wikipedia
library(Quandl)    # provider of financial data
library(lubridate)
library(tidyverse) 
library(gtrendsR)  # access Google trends API
# ggplot defaults
theme_set(theme_bw()) 
scale_colour_discrete &lt;- function(...) scale_color_brewer(palette=&quot;Set1&quot;)</code></pre>
</div>
<div id="define-a-wrapper-function-to-access-a-wikipedia-api" class="section level4">
<h4>Define a wrapper function to access a Wikipedia API</h4>
<p>The function contains quite a few of hardwired parameters. The <a href="https://github.com/ironholds/pageviews"><code>pageviews</code></a> package fetches the data. The function could be made a lot more flexible by adding more arguments, but that is not necessary for this blogpost.</p>
<p>The search function only works for terms for which an article exists <em>with the same title</em> in both the German and the English Wikipedia.</p>
<p>Luckily “Bitcoin” is such a term.</p>
<pre class="r"><code># Get the pageviews for &quot;Search term&quot;
# pageview data is available since 2015
startdate &lt;- ymd(&quot;20150101&quot;)
enddate &lt;- now()

wikipedia_de_vs_en &lt;- function(term = &quot;Bitcoin&quot;) {
  # call English wikipedia        
  pageviews &lt;- article_pageviews(
    project = &quot;en.wikipedia&quot;,
    article = term,
    user_type = &quot;user&quot;,

    mutate(language = case_when(
      language == &quot;en&quot; ~ &quot;English Wikipedia&quot;,
      language == &quot;de&quot; ~ &quot;German Wikipedia&quot;
    ))

  #plot it with 2 panels
  ggplot(pageviews.df, aes(date, views, color = language)) +
    geom_line() +
    xlab(&quot;&quot;) + ylab(&quot;Views per Day&quot;) +
    theme(legend.position = &quot;none&quot;) +

      sprintf(&quot;Daily Pageviews of &#39;%s&#39; in the English and German Wikipedias&quot;, term),

<h3>Data Visualization</h3>
<p>(If you want to follow along, or verify the data: An interactive frontend that does the same is available at this url: <a href="https://tools.wmflabs.org/pageviews/?project=en.wikipedia.org&amp;platform=all-access&amp;agent=user&amp;range=latest-20&amp;pages=Bitcoin">https://tools.wmflabs.org</a> )</p>
<p>Get some data for the Wikipedia article on Bitcoin:</p>
<p><img src="/post/2018-01-20-interest-in-bitcoin-over-time_files/figure-html/btc-1.png" width="864" /></p>
<p>Get some data for the article on Ethereum, another popular cryptocurrency (at this time).</p>
<p><img src="/post/2018-01-20-interest-in-bitcoin-over-time_files/figure-html/eth-1.png" width="864" /></p>
<p>These plots show a lot of things.</p>
<ul>
<li>Unsurprisingly, the interest (measured in pageviews) in the English version of the Wikipedia articles is consistently higher than interest in the German version. About 5 times as high.</li>
<li>Accesses to the Wikipedia articles peaked quite a few times even before the 2017 craze started. (I haven’t looked it up what these events were. Ransomware spreads, perhaps?).</li>
<li>Interest in Ethereum seems to be disproportionally high in Germany: English pageviews were “only” 3 times as high as German pageviews (usually it’s 5 times as high).<br />
</li>
<li>Strong peaks in Ethereum-article pageviews often occured independently from Bitcoin-Article pageviews, for both language articles.</li>
<li>(TBC)</li>
</ul>
<p>There is another, alternative data source: Google Trends API, here accessed with functions from the <a href="https://github.com/PMassicotte/gtrendsR">gtrendsR</a> package. The API provides aggregated and rescaled data on how many people have performed Google searches for any term.</p>
<p>Show a plot for comparison:</p>
<pre class="r"><code>bitcoin_trends$interest_over_time %&gt;%
  filter(date &gt;= as.Date(&quot;2015-01-01&quot;)) %&gt;%
  ggplot(aes(date, hits)) +
  geom_line() +
  theme(legend.position = &quot;none&quot;) +
  xlab(&quot;&quot;) + ylab(&quot;Interest&quot;) +
  ggtitle(
    sprintf(&quot;Google Trends: Worlwide Interest over Time in &#39;%s&#39;&quot;, &quot;Bitcoin&quot;),
    subtitle = &quot;(Google internal counters)&quot;
  )</code></pre>

<p>In order to make the Google-Trends-API plot comparable to the other plots above, I have restricted the data to the interval from 2015 to 2018. Thus I have left out a small but notable spike in the gloabl interest in bitcoin that happended in 2014.</p>
<div id="another-obligatory-comparison" class="section level4">
<h4>Another obligatory comparison</h4>
<p>Last but not least: the exchange rate for Bitcoin, here given in Euro. Data are from <a href="https://www.bitcoin.de">Bitcoin.de</a>, aggregated by <a href="https://docs.quandl.com/docs/time-series">Quandl</a>.</p>
<pre class="r"><code>btc &lt;- Quandl(code = &quot;BCHARTS/BTCDEEUR&quot;, type = &quot;xts&quot;)
autoplot(btc$Close[&quot;2015-01-01/&quot;]) +
        ylab(&quot;Bitcoin/EUR&quot;) + xlab(&quot;Year&quot;) +
        ggtitle(&quot;Bitcoin Exchange Rate 2015-2018&quot;,
                subtitle=&quot;&#39;Close Price&#39; in EUR, according to the Bitcoin.de trading platform. Data from Quandl.com.&quot;)</code></pre>
<p><img src="/post/2018-01-20-interest-in-bitcoin-over-time_files/figure-html/quandl-1.png" width="864" /></p>
<p>What many people talk about is the ‘volatility’ of Bitcoin. Rarely have I seen someone visualizing this, so here is another plot showing the daily change in the ‘closing price’ <em>(do these trading platforms really close?)</em> for 1 Bitcoin, in Euro:</p>
<pre class="r"><code>autoplot(diff(btc$Close[&quot;2015-01-01/&quot;])) +
        ylab(&quot;Daily Price Change, in EUR/day &quot;) + xlab(&quot;Year&quot;) +
        ggtitle(&quot;Volatility of Bitcoin &#39;Close Price&#39; 2015-2018&quot;,
                subtitle=&quot;in EUR, according to the Bitcoin.de trading platform. Data from Quandl.com.&quot;)</code></pre>
<p><img src="/post/2018-01-20-interest-in-bitcoin-over-time_files/figure-html/btcdiff-1.png" width="864" /></p>
<p>I’ve never seen any financial time series like that.</p>
