### A grabbag of ![](/img/portfolio/jq-med.png) commands 


> Some notes about learning jq, the  lightweight and flexible command-line JSON processor. Maybe I'll extend and improve this blog post in the next months. 



I need to be fluent with the JSON parsing tool [jq](https://stedolan.github.io/jq/).
Very often I have to interact with JSON data: When I interact with APIs,
when parsing scraped Twitter data, when doing SPARQL queries... 


Here I've saved some of my own mini-scripts and shortcuts that I have developed for my own needs. Most of it is already available in similar form, on the internet, but it is not available in a form that I found useful.



The following text snippets emerged by entering commands on the Unix command line.
This was a trial and error process.


The format of the snippets below is a pipe of shell commands.

`<infile.json jq-cmd1 jq-cmd2 std-cmd1 std-cmd2 ... `

The infile.json I've saved beforehand using a [small python script](https://stackoverflow.com/a/47791375/202553).

The infile contains one Tweet per line. The file as a whole is not a valid JSON file. For this reason I need the first `jq` command. It converts the collection of JSON fragments into an array of JSON objects and some  transforming/filtering into another sequence of JSON fragments. The second `jq` command converts the transformed JSON into a csv file. This jq-cmd is so complex that I've factored out into a sall file which sits int the same directory, called `to_csv.jq`.  

#### Example 1 - extract tweet text

This snippet extracts the text from a file that I created by saving data from the Twitter streaming API:

```
< raw_tweets/stream__AGU17.json jq -s '[.[] | {text: .text}] ' \
   | jq  -f -r to_csv.jq  | grep -i "rstats" | sort -u
```


#### Example 2 - extract more than 1 field from Tweets 

This is a variant of Example 1. Extract 5 fields from different levels of the tweet into a csv file with brief column names.


```
<raw_tweets/stream_rstats.json jq  -s  -S  '[.[] | \
   {name:  .user.name, sn: .user.screen_name, loc: .user.location, \
   url:.user.url, desc:.user.description, _fol: .user.followers_count }]'   | \
   jq  -f -r to_csv.jq

```

#### Helper function `to_csv()`

This is from a [Stackoverflow Answer](https://stackoverflow.com/a/44012345/202553) on the question *How to convert arbirtrary simple JSON to CSV using jq?*  

```

def tocsv($x):
    $x
    |(map(keys)
        |add
        |unique
        |sort
    ) as $cols
    |map(. as $row
        |$cols
        |map($row[.]|tostring)
    ) as $rows
    |$cols,$rows[]
    | @csv;

tocsv(.)


```

#### Further processing

Further processing on the command line can be done with the `[csvkit](http://csvkit.readthedocs.io/en/1.0.2/tricks.html#installation)` suite of tools.

This is an example:

```
<raw_tweets/stream_rstats.json jq  -s  -S \
'[.[] | {name:  .user.name, sn: .user.screen_name, \
loc: .user.location, \
url:.user.url, \
desc:.user.description, \
_fol: .user.followers_count }]'   | \
jq  -f -r to_csv.jq    | \
 csvsort -H -c 1    | csvcut -c 5,2 -l | csvlook --max-column-width 30 --max-rows 10

```

It produces this output:

(This table is not very informative, but that's intentional. The content of the tweets is irrelevant here).

```
| line_number | f                              | c              |
