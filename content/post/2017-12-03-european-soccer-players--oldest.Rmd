summary: While doing some quality-checks in Kaggle Dataset "[European Soccer Database](https://www.kaggle.com/hugomathien/soccer)", I found that in the late 2000s the oldest player active in top clubs was Tugay Kerimoğlu, from Turkey. Born in 1970, he played the English Premier League until... when, exactly?

### Still playing with a Soccer Database from Kaggle.com

> As an exercise, I wanted to find the oldest player participating in any match. My analysis also revealed a lot about the data quality of this Kaggle dataset.

As mentioned in a [previous blogpost](/post/2017/11/european-soccer-players-and-their-bmi/), I've downloaded a [zipfile (36 MB)](https://www.kaggle.com/hugomathien/soccer/downloads/soccer.zip) with Football data from data science community [Kaggle.com](https://www.kaggle.com/hugomathien/soccer). The archive contained an SQLite Database. 

```{r DBI, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}

library(DBI)
con <- dbConnect(odbc::odbc(), "well-sqlite-footballdb")

```

For the sake of brevity, to see the R packages I've included to process the data, see the [previous blogpost](/post/2017/11/european-soccer-players-and-their-bmi/). Only the `tidyr` package is new here.

```{r message=FALSE, warning=FALSE, results='hide', echo=FALSE}
# tidyverse packages
library(dplyr, warn.conflicts = FALSE) # 
library(tidyr)   # gather
library(purrr)   # functional programming
library(stringr)
library(lubridate) # strings to datetime
library(ggplot2)

theme_set(theme_bw())

```

```{r message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
library(tidyr)   # gather
```

The database consists of 7 tables. We'll read in all of them. The Player table contains basic data of ~10000 soccer players from the top leagues of 14 European countries. They are not strictly "European soccer players", but players from all over the globe, competing in the top leagues of certain Western European countries.

```{r, echo=FALSE, results='hide'}
table_names <- dbListTables(con)

good <- !  str_detect(table_names, "sqlite_sequence")
table_names <- table_names[good]

# Import all tables as data frames, 308MB
# feasible with lots of RAM
walk(table_names,function(x) assign(x, 
                                    dbReadTable(x, conn=con),
                                    envir = globalenv()))
dbDisconnect(con)
```

Tables in the Sqlite database:

```{r tables, echo=FALSE, results='hide'}

tab <- data.frame(Rows=map_dbl(table_names, ~nrow(get(.))))
tab2 <- data.frame(Rows=map_dbl(table_names, ~ncol(get(.))))
colnames(tab2) <- "Columns"
tab <- cbind(tab, tab2)
rownames(tab) <- table_names

```
```{r echo=FALSE}
tab
```


The `Player` table lists the soccer players' data.

```{r echo=FALSE}
mrng <- Match %>%  select(date) %>% mutate(date = as.Date(date)) %>% summarize(min= min(date), max=max(date))
```

The `Match` table contains data from  `r nrow(Match)`  matches, played between `r mrng$min` and `r mrng$max`. The table contains `r length( colnames(Match))` columns.



The names of the players comprising the teams are  listed in
22 columns named `home_player_1` to `home_player_11`, and `away_player_1` to `away_player_11`. The substitute players nominated for the match are not known. 

This database table has an untidy format. Let's tidy it with the `tidyr::gather()` function:

```{r}

Match_players  <- Match %>%
        select(match_api_id, season, league_id, 
               home_player_1:away_player_11) %>%
        rename("match_id" = match_api_id)  %>%
        gather( k, player_api_id,  -match_id, -season, -league_id)
```

This table now looks like this:

```{r}
head(Match_players %>% filter(!is.na(player_api_id)), 5)
```

I've only shown 5 rows of this `r nrow(Match_players)` x `r ncol(Match_players)` table. 
This table can now be joined with the `Player` table:

```{r}
Player_in_match <- Player %>%
        inner_join(Match_players, by = c("id" = "player_api_id")) %>%
        mutate(year_of_birth = year(birthday)) %>%
        rename("player_id" = id)
```

This table, `Player_in_match` is a `r nrow(Player_in_match)` x `r ncol(Player_in_match)` table. Remember, the original, standalone `Player` table had `r nrow(Player)` records.
The join reduced this to `r nrow(Player_in_match)` athletes. Hence, many players didn't actually play, or the screenscraping process did not yield any information about the matches they 've participated in; or the parse-process of many downloaded files containing the matches data failed. In any case, they actually played or were nominated for the starting formation of their squads. 

### Histogram of year of births of players that actually played  

This code generates a histogram of the "age distribution" of players in the dataset. These are players for which match data is known. I think the axes are pretty self-explanatory. 

```{r histogram, fig.width=7}
Pl_lbl <- Player_in_match %>%
        select(year_of_birth, player_name) %>% 
        group_by(year_of_birth) %>% 
        arrange(year_of_birth) %>% head(1)


Player_in_match %>%
        ggplot(aes(year_of_birth)) + 
        geom_histogram(binwidth=1, fill="maroon") +
        geom_text(data = Pl_lbl, 
                  aes(x=I(year_of_birth+1.5), y=I(150), 
                      label = player_name, angle = 45), size=3) +
        ggtitle(sprintf("Soccer matches played by %s soccer players in top leagues in Europe, 2008-2016", nrow(Player_in_match)),
                subtitle="Histogram shows players for which match participation data is known.") +
        xlab("Year of Birth") +
        ylab("Appearances in Matches")
```


### Find the oldest player in any match

We can use the `Player_in_match` table to find the oldest player who participated in any match. This corresponds to the leftmost bar in the histogram above.

```{r oldest, results='hide'}
oldest_players_in_any_match <- Player_in_match %>%
        inner_join(League, by = c("league_id" = "id") ) %>%
        filter(year_of_birth < 1971) %>%
        select(year_of_birth, season, player_name, match_id, name) %>%
        group_by(year_of_birth, season, player_name, match_id) %>%
        summarize(n_matches = n()) %>%
        arrange(season, match_id) %>%
        ungroup()
```

Result:

```{r tab1}

(oldest <- oldest_players_in_any_match %>% 
        select(player_name, year_of_birth) %>% 
        head(1))

```

Before I studied this dataset, the oldest player, Tugay Kerimoğlu, was completely unknown to me. So let's lookup some metadata about this player in the Google Knowledge Graph.

The  calculation in the following code block is a bit awkward and verbose, because

 - Google Knowledge Graph does *not* return records with a perfectly consistent structure. I have to transform it to a consistent 2-column (key-value) table.
 - the Google Knowledge Graph data contains irrelevant info such as license data about photographs etc that I had too filter out. 
 - the database does not keep track of accents and special characters of the Turkish alphabet, so I better use the correctly encoded string from Wikipedia/Google.
 
```{r, googlekg, result='hide', echo=TRUE, warning=FALSE, message=FALSE}

oldest.2 <- map(oldest$player_name, 
                kgapi_lookup_kv, 
                apikey=Sys.getenv("GOO_KGR_KEY"))

oldest.3 <- oldest.2[[1]] %>% 
    as_data_frame( ) %>% 
    filter(str_detect(key, "result.name|detailedDescription") == TRUE) %>% 
    select(key, value) %>% 
    mutate(key = str_replace(key, "result.detailedDescription.", ""), 
           value = unlist(value)) %>% 
    spread(key=key, value=value) %>% 
    select(-license) %>% 
    mutate(Name =str_c("[", result.name, "](", url, ")"),
           Description = articleBody) %>% 
    select(Name,  Description) %>% 
    cbind(oldest) %>% 
    rename("Born" = "year_of_birth") %>% 
    select(-player_name)
  
```


Click on the Wikipedia link below for more information: 


```{r echo=FALSE}
knitr::kable(oldest.3, table.attr = "id=\"oldestkg\"",
             row.names = FALSE,  format = "markdown" )
```

## More quality checks: Tugay's last matches

So Wikipedia says Tugay played for the Blackburn Rovers.

Does the database also say that? Sadly, no:

Let's find out which teams Tugay played for during his last seasons. For each record in the Match table, there exists an entry with `home_team_api_id` and `away_team_api_id`. In order to resolve anonymous team-ids to the actual team names, I 
join the team-ids *twice* to the oldest_players_in_any_match table. This yields two augmented temporary tables.

```{r}
# get a smaller version of the Team table
Team_sm <- Team %>%  select(id, team_api_id, team_long_name)

oldest_augm <- oldest_players_in_any_match %>%
        select(-season) %>%
        inner_join(Match, by = c("match_id" = "match_api_id")) %>%
        inner_join(Team_sm, by = c("home_team_api_id" = "team_api_id")) %>%
        rename("home_team" = "team_long_name")


oldest_augm2 <- oldest_augm %>%
        inner_join(Team_sm, by = c("away_team_api_id" = "team_api_id")) %>%
        rename("away_team" = "team_long_name")

oldest_augm2 %>%
        select(season, match_id, home_team, away_team) %>%
        arrange(season, match_id) %>% 
        ht()           # head() and tail()

```

So the database says that Tugay Kerimoğlu has played for Everton, and did so until the 2011/2012 season (I've omitted a few matches in the table above). According to the [Wikipedia article about him](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tugay_Kerimo%C4%9Flu), this is clearly wrong. 

### My take home-message

So the take-home message is that the Kaggle database has some quality issues. Needless to say, the creators of the database still did a great job in compiling this dataset.
The database design is pretty clean, and the fact that there are even some Primary-Foreign Key Constraints between the table inside the database make it stand out. However the mappings of team-ids to match-ids seem to be wrong in places, or I did a mistake in the analysis.

### Minor quality problem: players with digits in their names

Further examination revealed that another small problem with the Players table. 

This R code reveals that some player names have been parsed incorrectly. 

```{r}
players_weird_names <- Player %>% 
        select(player_name) %>% 
        filter(str_detect(player_name, "\\d") == TRUE)

plw <- players_weird_names %>% head(4)
plw <- plw %>% bind_rows(data_frame(player_name = "..."))
plw <- plw %>% bind_rows(tail(players_weird_names, 4))
```

```{r echo=FALSE}
knitr::kable(plw)
```

There are `r nrow(players_weird_names)` Players with digits in their names. I've only shown a few of them in the table above. This formatting issue looks so systematic that I suspect that it is the result of an incorrect parse, and maybe a misplaced age calculation.
