####  Feature engineering and variable imputation

```

This is a follow-up to [an exploratory data-analysis post](/post/2018/02/bloodpressure-nhanes) of mine. When I was nearly done with writing that post, some new questions came to my mind.

Here I'll continue with preprocessing. More basically, can I determine some other variables (out of the `r ncol(NHANES)`) that are -apparently- influencing the Blood Pressure in some way? 

I am not trying to do groundbreaking medical research here. Hey I'm just a blogger, playing with a dataset for personal entertainment, trying out some of those fancy Machine Learning algorithms that I encountered during MOOC homework assignments. This time I'll try these techniques out on a larger dataset that *I* find interesting.

Attribute selection and variable imputation are a topic worth studying, especially on a more complex dataset such as the NHANES data.

#### The NHANES dataset

NHANES is  the US National Health and Nutrition Examination Study. It is a carefully curated, larger medical survey aiming to get a representative sample of the general US population. The survey is carried out periodically.

The [*NHANES* dataset](https://www.cdc.gov/nchs/nhanes/participant_video.htm) is available as an R package on [CRAN](https://cran.r-project.org/package=NHANES). I have used package version 2.1.0, specifically "NHANES 2009-2012 with adjusted weighting".
```{r}
htmltools::HTML('<a name="top"></a>')
```

Table 1 shows  the column names and further below, and in [table 5](#metadata), are some other important metadata of the NHANES dataset. 

This dataset contains data from two collection periods, 2009-2010 and 2011-2012. Some attributes weres collected during period 1, but not in period 2, or they were collected in different ways. Therefore the dataset contains many NULL values just because of this. Moreover some attributes are valid only for women ("nBabies"), and other features such as "HeadCirc" (head circumference), were only collected for babies and children.  


#### Feature Engineering

These are the feature selection steps I will apply.
Some attributes are redundant, for exaample age-in-years, age-in-months and age-decade. Many blood-pressure values are redundant; keep only the average value. 
First, remove attributes that were collected for babies, children and generally people from the youngest age groups, less than 20 years of age.
This leads to the selection of columns, marked by me as "drop" in Table 1 below.


```{r names_defs}
x <- read_html(x = here::here("data_private/nhanes_datadict_raw.html"))
dls <- html_nodes(x, xpath="//dl") 
nhanes_defs = data.frame()
dl <- dls[[1]]
dts <- html_nodes(dl, xpath="//dt")  
dds <- html_nodes(dl, xpath="//dd")
nhanes_defs <- data_frame(
                  "Column" = dts %>% 
                           html_nodes(xpath='//dt')%>% html_text(),
                   "Meaning" = dds %>% html_nodes(xpath='//dd')%>% 
                           html_text() %>% str_trim() %>% 
                           str_replace_all("\t", " ") %>%  
                           str_replace("\"","")
                   )
```

```{r drop}

action1 <- "drop"
action2 <- "Yes/No"

nhanes_defs <- nhanes_defs %>%
        mutate(Action= case_when(
# (str_detect(Meaning, "Yes") == TRUE)  & 
#  str_detect(Meaning, "No") == TRUE ~ action2, 
               
         Column == "ID" ~ action1,
         Column == "SurveyYr" ~ action1,        
         Column == "ID" ~ action1,
         Column == "AgeMonths" ~ action1,

         Column == "BMI_WHO" ~ action1,
         str_detect(Column, pattern=regex("^BP")) == TRUE &
            str_detect(Column, pattern=regex("Ave")) == FALSE ~ action1,
         str_detect(Column, pattern=regex("^TVHrs")) == TRUE ~ action1,
         str_detect(Column, pattern=regex("^CompHrs")) == TRUE ~ action1,
         # Column == "nPregnancies" ~ action1,
         # Column == "nBabies" ~ action1,
         # Column == "PregnantNow" ~ action1, # drop later
         # Column == "Age1stBaby" ~ action1,
         str_detect(Column, "WTINT2YR") == TRUE ~ action1,
         #Column == "TVHrsDayChild" ~ action1,
         #Column == "CompHrsDayChild" ~ action1,
#         str_detect(Column, pattern=regex("TVHrs|CompHrs|AgeDecade")) ==
#                 TRUE ~ action1,
         TRUE ~ ""))

```

```{r tabledef, cache=FALSE}

knitr::kable(nhanes_defs, row.names = 1, 
              caption = "Column names in NHANES data set,\
              and columns that will be dropped") %>% 
        kable_styling(bootstrap_options = 
                c("striped", "hover"))

```

```{r dropcols}

drop_cols <- nhanes_defs %>% 
        filter(Action == action1) %>% select(Column) %>%
        as_vector()

# factor_cols <- nhanes_defs %>% 
#         filter(Action == action2) %>% select(Column) %>% 
#         as_vector()
# dfr <- NHANES %>% select(Age, AgeDecade) %>% filter(is.na(AgeDecade))


```





```{r NHANES_imputed, echo=FALSE, error=TRUE}

NHANES <- NHANES %>% 
        filter(Age >= 20) %>% 
        select(setdiff(colnames(NHANES), drop_cols) )

wd <- "content/post"
if(! str_detect(getwd(), wd)) {
        setwd(wd) 
}

NHimp_file<- "../../data_private/NHANES-imputed.rds"

if (file.exists(NHimp_file)){
        NHANES_mice <- readRDS(NHimp_file)
        NHANES_imputed <- mice::complete(NHANES_mice)
} else {
        cols_few_NAs <- colSums(apply(NHANES, 2, is.na)) 
        # if more than 1000 NAs per column, drop column
        cols_few_NAs <- data_frame(col=names(cols_few_NAs), 
                              val=cols_few_NAs) %>% 
                filter(val <= 1000 | col == "PregnantNow") 
        NHANES <- NHANES[ , cols_few_NAs$col]
                NHANES_mice <- mice(NHANES, seed=47)
        NHANES_imputed <- mice::complete(mice(NHANES))
        saveRDS(NHANES_mice, file = NHimp_file)
        #stripplot(NHANES_mice, pch=20, cex=1.2)
}

```

These are the remaining columns in the NHANES dataset and the number of NA values in each column, respectively:


```{r nmissing}
data_frame(`Column Name` = names(NHANES_mice$nmis),
           `Number of NAs` = NHANES_mice$nmis) %>% 
        kable(row.names = 1, 
              caption = "Column names in NHANES data set,\
              after removal of redundant and inapplicable columns, and number of NAs. (PregnantNow is the most extreme example, and is kept on purpose.") %>% 
        kable_styling(bootstrap_options = 
                c("striped", "hover"))
```

#### Variable imputation

Imputation is done with the [MICE method](http://stefvanbuuren.github.io/mice/): "Multiple Imputation by Chained Equations".

The MICE method  removes all NA values by  guessing intelligently. 
Here I have called the `mice()` function with default parameters.
This is why it created nonsensical values in places, e.g. pregnant fathers., see below.

```{r cols_nas}

cols_nas <- md.pattern(NHANES) %>% 
        tail(1) %>% # find total NAS in all colnames
        t() %>%  # convert to data frame
        as.data.frame() %>%  rownames_to_column() %>%
        rename("Colname"="rowname", "Num_NAs"="V1")

#length(md.pairs(NHANES))
#md.pattern(NHANES)

# object.size(NHANES_mice)
# object.size(NHANES_imputed)
# object.size(NHANES)
#library(VIM)
#marginplot(NHANES[, c("BMI", "UrineVol1")])
#NHANES <-
# impute only to columns with lesss than 1000 NAs, drop all others
# cols_nas[1:nrow(cols_nas)-1,] %>% ggplot(aes(Colname, Num_NAs)) +
#         geom_col() + theme(axis.text.x = element_text(angle=90))


```

```{r pregnant, eval=TRUE}

table(NHANES$Gender, NHANES$PregnantNow, useNA = "always") %>% 
     #   prop.table() %>%
     #   round(digits = 2) %>%         
        kable(caption= "Column 'PregnantNow', Before Imputation:")

```



```{r pregnant2, eval=TRUE}
table(NHANES_imputed$Gender, NHANES_imputed$PregnantNow, useNA = "always") %>%
      #  prop.table() %>%
      #  round(digits = 2) %>% 
        kable(caption= "Column 'PregnantNow', After Imputation:")
```
`PregnantNow` is the most extreme example- more than 50% NA values were undefined for this column. 

This demonstrates that the default  choices that the `mice()` function makes are not always suitable for this dataset. For now, I'll leave these new values inside the imputed dataset though.

[According to the authors of the mice package](https://www.jstatsoft.org/index.php/jss/article/view/v045i03) these decisions need to be made:

1. Assumption: Missing at random satisfied?
1. Target Model / intended Use of the data
1. Set of variables
4. Include dependent variables
1. Order of imputation
1. intiializations and number of iterations
1. number of imputations (how many *multiple* imputations)



(TBC -  imputation done better - the `mice` package is a lot more flexible and has more to offer to achieve better imputations)

```{r eval=FALSE, echo=TRUE}
#NHANES_imp_qik <- quickpred(NHANES)
NHANES_imp_qik <- mice (NHANES, pred = quickpred(NHANES, minpuc = 0.25), include = "Age", maxit= 1)
NHANES_imp_qik_complete <- mice::complete(NHANES_imp_qik)
#table(NHANES_imp_qik_complete$PregnantNow, NHANES_imp_qik_complete$Gender)
```

```{r}
htmltools::HTML('<div class="alert alert-danger"><b>NOTE</b>
                The imputation process with default values did not really produce  meaningful values. Moreover, using ~50 columns is a bit too much, both for modeling as well as for imputation. 
However  my goal was to try out model selection algorithms, 
and imputing correctly was less a concern.  
                </div>')
```

However, after imputation  there are no more NAs in any column of the NHANES Dataset.

These metadata show, for example, the unique distinct values of columns where it makes sense to report them (e.g. male/female for column "gender").
