<h4>Blood Pressure as a function of age and body weight</h4>
<div class="alert alert-info"><b>Very basic analysis of two health datasets about the  General US Population in 2010.</b>
                The data were gathered independently. One of them is a tiny teaching dataset, the other is a large study. Both datasets show that blood pressure rises about 5 mm Hg per decade. </div>
<p>Conversations with friends and colleagues kept me thinking about blood pressure lately. Then I’ve remembered that weekend project from late 2017. Back then I had analysed two datasets: one available on the internet, the other available as R package NHANES on CRAN. My motivation in writing this up was half learning <em>ggplot</em>, half gaining insights from data by moving from a small teaching dataset to a messy, much larger dataset from a real medical study.</p>
<p>Load the necessary packages. Nothing fancy here.</p>
<p>Download <strong>dataset 1</strong>: A tiny 11x4 table called <code>Systolic Blood Pressure</code>. It comes from <a href="http://college.cengage.com/mathematics/brase/understandable_statistics/7e/students/datasets/mlr/frames/frame.html">a book publisher’s website.</a>. Maybe it is a teaching dataset, perhaps supplementary material for a college textbook.</p>
<p>The <a href="https://github.com/knbknb/kbehrends.netlify.com/tree/master/content">markdown version of this blog post</a> contains the necessary instructions on how to download and import the data.</p>
<p>The dataset is tiny:</p>
<pre><code>## Observations: 11
## Variables: 4
## $ blood_pressure &lt;int&gt; 132, 143, 153, 162, 154, 168, 137, 149, 159, 12...
## $ age            &lt;int&gt; 52, 59, 67, 73, 64, 74, 54, 61, 65, 46, 72
## $ weight_pounds  &lt;int&gt; 173, 184, 194, 211, 196, 220, 188, 188, 207, 16...
## $ weight         &lt;dbl&gt; 78.5, 83.5, 88.0, 95.7, 88.9, 99.8, 85.3, 85.3,...</code></pre>
<p>We can plot it in its entirety. I also fit a simple linear regression mode to the data. Blood Pressure as a function of a person’s age and body weight.</p>
<p>Adding the predictions from the model:</p>

<p>The linear regression model shows a strong correlation with age.</p>

<p>The model predicts that for every year of one’s life the systolic pressure increases 0.861 mm Hg/year. That’s almost <strong>10 mm Hg per decade</strong>! Quite a lot. Is this realistic? Or is this a fictitious dataset? Is the trend correct, but the value is not? In other words, is the sample nonrepresentative of the population? Is there a confounding factor? We haven’t looked at body weight yet!</p>
<p>Let’s try a larger dataset!</p>
<div class="alert alert-info"><b>What I learned from doing this</b>
<ul>
<li> Gaining insights by switching from a tiny to a big dataset.
<li> New tricks with ggplot2
<li> Splitting continuous data into categories / age classes was really helpful here
    </ul>
