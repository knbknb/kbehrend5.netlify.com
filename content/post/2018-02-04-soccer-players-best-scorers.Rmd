#### Scoring averages of soccer players

This is part 3 of a 3-part series about Statistical Analysis of Soccer data. 

- [Part 1](/post/2017/12/soccerdb-schema-diagrams/) shows the database diagram of the Sqlite database mentioned below.
- [Part 2](/post/2017/12/database/) describes how to preprocess some text data that was stored in an cryptic format inside the database
- Part 3  (this page)  describes some statistical analysis of some aspect of this dataset.

#### Dataset 


The dataset used here is the ["European Soccer Database" - 25k+ matches, players & teams attributes for European Professional Football](https://www.kaggle.com/hugomathien/soccer/) from Kaggle.com. This dataset is delivered as an Sqlite database. It contains 7 tables which have been populated by the original curator in 2014-2016.
The data comes from many internet sources.

```{r DBI, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE, echo=FALSE}

library(DBI)
con <- dbConnect(odbc::odbc(), "well-sqlite-footballdb")

```
For the sake of brevity, I cannot repeat this information here. To see database internals, see the [previous blogpost](/post/2017/12/soccerdb-schema-diagrams/). 

```{r }
library(lubridate) # strings to datetime
library(tidyverse, warn.conflicts = FALSE)

theme_set(theme_bw())
scale_colour_discrete <- function(...) scale_color_brewer(palette="Set2")
```


```{r}

```
