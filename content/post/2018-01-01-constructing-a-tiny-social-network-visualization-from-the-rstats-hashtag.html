<h2>(Under Construction)</h2>
<p>In 2016, I was harvesting tweets from the Twitter streaming API. I’ve used the <code>#rstats</code> hashtag as the search filter. This hashtag is commonly used by the R community on Twitter. Tag <code>#rstats</code> is more descriptive than the too short, unusable, <code>#R</code> hashtag which may not even be a valid filter expression.</p>
<p>Here I do some exploratory analysis of these ~ 1000 tweets, and I visualize the interactions (the “mentions”) of the active Twitter users as a directed graph.</p>
<p>This blogpost is inspired by the Datacamp Class <a href="https://www.datacamp.com/courses/network-analysis-in-r">‘Network Analysis in R’</a></p>
<div id="preprocessing" class="section level4">
<h4>Preprocessing</h4>
<p>Load the necessary R packages, and the datafiles.</p>
<pre class="r"><code>library(here)       # filesystem
library(stringr)    #
library(lubridate)  # dateformats
library(threejs)    # interactive plot

infile1 &lt;- here::here(datadir, &quot;rstats_network.txt&quot;)
infile2 &lt;- here::here(datadir, &quot;rstats_tweettext.txt&quot;)</code></pre>
<p>Convert dates to strings, group them into day-of-month, and hours-of-day:</p>
<pre class="r"><code>tweettexts &lt;- read_json(infile2, simplifyVector = TRUE) %&gt;% 
        select(-dt)

tweetdates &lt;- read_csv(infile0)
# rstats_tweettimes.txt:  &quot;Sun Jul 10 08:14:23 +0000 2016&quot;
tweetdates &lt;- tweetdates %&gt;% 
        mutate(dt = str_replace(dt, &quot;\\+0000 &quot;, &quot;&quot;),
               dt = str_replace(dt, &quot;^\\w+ &quot;, &quot;&quot;),
               dt = parse_date_time(dt, orders = c(&quot;b d  H:M:S Y&quot;)),
               day = day(dt),
               day = sprintf(&quot;July %02d&quot;, day),
               hour = hour(dt))

tweetdates &lt;- tweetdates %&gt;% inner_join(tweettexts, by = &quot;id&quot;)</code></pre>
<p>During the 34 hours from 2016-07-08 22:17:33 to 2016-07-10 08:14:23 I gathered 977 tweets, encoded in JSON format.<br />
Each tweet contains about 2500 characters. This might surprise you, because a tweet used to be 140 characters in length, until Twitter increased it to 280 characters in 2017. But a tweet contains a lot of metadata, and this makes a tweet exceed 2000 characters when serialized to a compact JSON string (<em>not</em> pretty-printed).</p>
<p>In a different blogpost (‘<a href="/post/2017/12/learning-jq">Learning jq</a>’) I’ve explained how to extract specific fields from the nested structure. See example 4.</p>

<div id="plot-activity-over-time" class="section level4">
<h4>Plot: Activity over time</h4>
<p>This plot shows the user activity during this 3-day period:</p>

<p>Why is there a peak that happened on July 09 2016 at ~ 15:00 h? Apparently, someone posted a new article <a href="https://www.r-bloggers.com/the-mathematics-of-machine-learning/?utm_source=feedburner&amp;utm_medium=twitter&amp;utm_campaign=Feed%3A+RBloggers+%28R+bloggers%29">“The Mathematics of Machine Learning”</a> on <a href="https://www.r-bloggers.com">R-bloggers.com</a>, and immediately the article link was shared (retweeted) many times. The article is not <em>that</em> great, so I suspect this sharing is no true human activity, but some form of Twitter spam, as shown below.</p>
<p>The tweet text that was shared 165 times was:</p>
<p><code>RT <span class="citation">@craigbrownphd</span>: The Mathematics of Machine Learning: (This article was first published on R – Data Scie… <a href="https://t.co/LO0G06avIl" class="uri">https://t.co/LO0G06avIl</a> #…</code></p>

<h4>Constructing the interactions network</h4>
<p>Using the jq tool, I’ve contructed a separate text file containing the user data and the important “mentions” metadata. Read in the file, as a data frame:</p>

<p>This means that the twitter user on the left mentioned or retweeted the person on the right.</p>
<p>Now I calculate a node-property called ‘<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eigenvector_centrality">Eigenvector-Centrality</a>’ <span class="math inline">\(ec\)</span>, a measure which gives higher scores to nodes that are well-connected with other well-connected nodes. The value of <span class="math inline">\(ec\)</span> is between 0 and 1, and most of them close to 0, so I also take logarithms, creating a two-column dataframe for easier plotting.</p>
<pre class="r"><code>ec &lt;- as.numeric(eigen_centrality(gr)$vector)
ecdf &lt;- data.frame(ec = ec, eclog = log(ec))</code></pre>
<p>A density plot of the eigenvector centrality shows its weird distribution:</p>

<p>The nodes with the smallest eigenvector centrality ec will be filled with the darkest blue, and nodes with higher-values of ec (close to 1) will be colored <em>dodgerblue</em>, which is similar to the iconic blue of the Twitter logo. Intermediate values will be colored pale blue.</p>
<pre class="r"><code>bluevals &lt;- map(ecdf$eclog, function(x, ec){

<p>Another notable feature in the network is the pale blue structure with the many tiny spheres attached. Interestingly, this represents the highly-retweeted tweet by “Craig Brown, Phd”, mentioned above. The announcement of a new article on r-bloggers was mentioned by a lot of people in their tweets, but the people who retweet him hardly got any mentions themselves. The users he mentions have names like ‘GimmieKiss’ and also have lots of emoticons in their names (Check by pointing the mouse over some of those pale blue nodes). Maybe this is a form of Twitter-Spam.</p>
<p>There are also some smaller communities (twitter users that refer to each other) that <em>do not</em> mention anyone from the larger R community. Maybe this is also spam. I haven’t looked, and I won’t show a table with member data here.</p>

<h4>More about the Hadley node</h4>
<p>The next plot shows a subgraph: only those nodes interconnected with the Hadley Node up to a geodesic distance of <code>length(colors)</code>.</p>
<p>The Hadley node has a black color, its next neighbors are shown in red, the neighbors of the neighbors (having a geodesic distance of 2) are orange, and so on.</p>
