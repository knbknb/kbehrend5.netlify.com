This is part 1 of a 3-part series of small blog posts about my first attempts at Bayesian Analysis of Soccer data. 

In order to get started I had to invest much more effort than expected into cleaning the data and getting familiar with it.

**tl;dr: This blog post shows 3 times the same database diagram, at varying levels of detail.**

#### Dataset

The dataset used here is the ["European Soccer Database" - 25k+ matches, players & teams attributes for European Professional Football](https://www.kaggle.com/hugomathien/soccer/) from Kaggle.com. This dataset is delivered as an Sqlite database. It contains 7 tables which have been filled by the original curator by scraping numerous websites many times in 2014-2016.




#### The database schema

The database schema can be viewed with the free [schemacrawler](http://www.schemacrawler.com/how-to.html) tool. 

> Note: To get schemacrawler to work properly, `Java` and `Graphviz` need to be installed on your computer. At this time, I do not know the minimum versions required for these tools. 

A basic command to list the database contents is 

```
# This is bash code for the unix command line
#
#  assign the absolute path to sqlite file to variable: db  
db="/home/knut/code/git/football-data-collection/football-data.sqlite"
#
# the actual shell command
./schemacrawler.sh -server sqlite -database $db -password="" -c list
```

Output:

```

Tables
========================================================================

Country                                                          [table]
League                                                           [table]
"Match"                                                          [table]
Player                                                           [table]
Player_Attributes                                                [table]
Team                                                             [table]
Team_Attributes                                                  [table]
```

There are no views defined in the database.

List the table contents:

(This result is similar to the previous one, )

Row Count
========================================================================

Row Count                                                               
------------------------------------------------------------------------
Country                                                          11 rows
League                                                           11 rows
"Match"                                                      25,979 rows
Player                                                       11,060 rows
Player_Attributes                                           183,978 rows
Team                                                            299 rows
Team_Attributes                                               1,458 rows
```

#### The "schema diagram"

Visualize these tables in a diagram, showing the tables, rowcounts, column names, columns datatypes, and their primarykey-foreignkey relationships between the tables. 

As explained in the [schemacrawler documentation](http://www.schemacrawler.com/diagramming.html), this can be done in many variants.

Command-line options used:

- To suppress schema names and foreign key names, use  `-portablenames`  
- Show only significant columns, such as primary and foreign key columns, and columns that are part of unique indexes: use `-infolevel=standard  -command=brief` .         
- optionally, to show column ordinals: set configuration option `schemacrawler.format.show_ordinal_numbers=true` in the configuration file `config/schemacrawler.config.properties`, as mentioned in the [documentation](http://www.schemacrawler.com/diagramming.html)

#### High-Level Diagram

This command can be used to create a PNG image file with a schema diagram.:

```
./schemacrawler.sh -server sqlite -database $db  -password="" \
   -infolevel=maximum -command=brief \ 
   -portablenames  -outputformat=png -outputfile=footballb--diagram--brief--no-constraintnames-colnum--rowcounts.png

```

This command yields this picture:


{{< figure src="/img/post/footballb--diagram--brief--no-constraintnames-colnum--rowcounts.png" title="↑ High-Level Diagram ↑" class="img-width-medium">}}


This diagram above is only high-level. A more accurate diagram would contain *all nonempty* columns in the tables and look like this:

#### "All relevant columns" diagram

{{< figure src="/img/post/footballb--diagram--no-playerXY-cols--no-constraintnames-colnum--rowcounts.png" title="↑ All nonempty columns Diagram↑  " class="img-width-medium">}}

The `Match` table contains a lot of columns from commercial betting companies. The 3-letter codes correspond to the odds and other bookie metadata.

#### "All columns" Diagram 

The actual `Match` table contains many columns that serve no apparent purpose. There are dozens of columns that have names such as `homePlayerX10`, `awayPlayPlayerY2`.... The full diagram looks quite bizarre, and is shown here only for completeness:

```
./schemacrawler.sh -server sqlite -database $db  -password="" \
-infolevel=maximum -command=schema -portablenames  -outputformat=png \
-outputfile=footballb--diagram--with-playerXY-cols--no-constraintnames-colnum--rowcounts.png 
```
