### Link Collections, Codesnippets and Cheatsheets for my own personal use

Github 'Gists' are code samples that are too short for, or not worth creating a new standalone repository.

For example

- Small snippets
- One-off scripts 
- unfinished/half-working scripts
- forked github gists from other people
- copies of codesamples from other people, slightly edited or customized

This webpage is just for my own personal use, a collection of cheatsheets.

For now, I list only the links to the gists. Maybe I'll include the full gists when appropriate.
