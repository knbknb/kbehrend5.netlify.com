<h4>Why this blog?</h4>
<p>This Blog will include musings about my personal interests: geosciences, datasciences, coding, photography, and more.</p>
<ul>
<li>Over the last years I’ve slowly realized that I want to get more practice to write clearly.</li>
<li>Towards my long term goal of establishing a reproducible-research workflow for myself, having a personal blog is a nice warm-up exercise, or routine.</li>
<li>On my hard drive I have many older documents and side projects. As long as they are not on the net, they are “dead”.</li>
<li>I’ve contributed stuff to a few forums and online exchanges, but in the long-term this is too widely dispersed to have any impact. Sometimes a series of postings really belongs together (to be useful to me), but is incoherently distributed over several sites. Often I cannot recover it myself, when I need to look something up that I once knew in greater detail, and wrote about.</li>
<li>For example, my documents on RPubs.com (the default site where you can publish/upload to, from within the Rstudio IDE), for instance, are also not really under version control. In fact they are not under anyone’s control.</li>
</ul>
<p>I’ve started the blog with a few posts about soccer data, for several reasons. One of them is that this subject fascinates a lot of people.</p>
