Well, I am not looking for work at this time. 

I've created this blog just for [personal development](/about), to create a new habit.

You can contact me via the links shown in the sidebar, or by using the form below. 

Ask me anything (but not too diffcult) about 

- working as a developer (focus on Geosciences), 
- R programming, 
- Typo3/LAMP development, 
- Ubuntu tinkering,
- anything else. 

*I'll check the mail account for this form infrequently, maybe once a week. Don't expect a quick response.*
