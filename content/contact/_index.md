Well, I am not looking for work at this time. 

I've created this blog just for personal development.

But you can always contact me via the links shown in the sidebar, or by using the form below. 

Ask me anything (but not too diffcult) about working as a geoscientist-developer in Germany, the Berlin area, R programming, typo3/LAMP development, Ubuntu tinkering, or anything else.
