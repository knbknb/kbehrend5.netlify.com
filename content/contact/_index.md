Well, I am not looking for work at this time. 

I've created this blog just for [personal development](/about).

But you can always contact me via the links shown in the sidebar, or by using the form below. 

Ask me anything (but not too diffcult) about 

- working as a developer (focus on Geosciences), 
- the Berlin area, or Germany, 
- R programming, 
- Typo3/LAMP development, 
- Ubuntu tinkering,
- anything else.
